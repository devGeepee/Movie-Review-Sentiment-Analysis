      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.<br/><br/>It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.<br/><br/>Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.<br/><br/>This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I won't say it's an underrated movie, but it has somewhat been buried by the legacy of other \"popular\" Nolan movies. With this movie, Nolan shows his ability to make a metacinematic film, yet again. This is obviously my most favorite Christopher Nolan movie, along with \"Memento\" (2000). Just like you can relate the theme of memories and interpretations shown in the story of \"Memento\" with the actual experience we had while watching the movie, we can relate the three acts of a magic trick narrated within the story with the movie itself. As the movie says, the final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. In fact, the whole movie can be weirdly related to a magic trick. It is one of those movies which feel quite ordinary until a major twist makes it great. Speaking of the cinematic experience, it is a typical Nolan styled movie. It has broken timelines to enhance the storytelling, but unlike in most of his movies these are done more artistically than just for the thrilling reveal. This is perhaps the movie where Nolan's broken timelines have enhanced the storytelling in the most brilliant way. Like in most of movies, he dwells in a single theme - here it's obsession. The obsession of Robert Angier is what drives the plot of the movie, and is well established and doesn't even feel forced. There is a protagonist, and an antagonist in this movie. The character development is done so smoothly that we see the protagonist become an antagonist, while the antagonist remains somewhat the same. Though we don't get a full \"interchange\" between the antagonist and the protagonist, as the movie progresses, the protagonist feels more \"wrong\" than the antagonist. That's quite a difficult thing that it pulls off. Alfred Bordon is one of the most \"complex\" characters I have ever seen. He feels like some kind of a prick throughout the movie, and there are a lot of scenes to establish it for the viewers. That's until we get to know his character in the third act. It doesn't make him right for his wrong doings, but he gets the respect for his dedication as a magician. The whole Tesla plotline might feel like a convenient plot device, but Tesla is a scientist who is rumoured to travel through time. So, that is quite justifiable. Hugh Jackman has given a solid performance. This must go down as his best performances with those of \"Prisoners\" (2013) and \"Logan\" (2017). He is completely out of his public persona of Wolverine. He is the best possible choice for Wolverine imo, but reminder of Wolverine every time he appears on screen isn't so adorable. He didn't remind me of Wolverine at all, in this movie. But, the major highlight of the movie would be Christian Bale. He has given a terrific performance. You don't even get a hint at the complexity of the character he is portraying. It's after the reveal and in fact, in the second viewing that you start noticing the actual stuffs and the actual interpretations a particular scene is to be given. All in all, it's a fantastic movie. The way obsession play out to be the main theme, the way broken timelines are used for storytelling and the way the final twist is revealed - simply excellent. It gets a special \"10/10\" and an \"A+\".</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The Prestige, adapted from an award winning novel of the same name by Christopher Priest, is an intricate tale of passion, intrigue, deceit and obsession about two illusionists, whose morbid covetousness for absolute supremacy in their profession engenders a fierce rivalry that turns internecine and ultimately consumes them. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) at the start of their careers are highly ambitious young men assisting an elderly illusionist named Milton. Borden's incessant longing for innovation leads to the accidental death of Angier's wife. Borden marries Sarah and his apparent happiness further aggravates the sense of revulsion in Angier's heart. Angier's vindictive intervention during a bullet catch trick causes Borden to lose his two fingers. Though these events sowed the seeds of implacable hatred, but it is the unremitting yearning of their perpetually insatiable egos to outperform each other that eventually drives them to perdition.<br/><br/>Angier starts performing with the sobriquet \"The Great Danton\" with Cutter (Michael Caine) as his illusion engineer, while Borden with the stage name \"The Professor\" with Fellon as his engineer. Angier is an adept showman, but lacks the technical prowess. On the contrary, Borden is highly skillful, but lacks the taste for grandeur and showmanship. Each regards the other as his only obstacle (owing to their bitterly intertwined past) and this starts a series of events in which each tries to stymie the other by any means possible (sabotage, abduction, incrimination and even killings). Awed by the apparent genuineness of Borden's version of \"The Transported Man\" and inveigled by Borden's deliberate misdirection, Angier travels miles and spends a fortune to approach an ingenious scientist named Nikola Tesla (David Bowie) in order to cajole him into building a machine for him (a machine that could help him outperform Borden). Nikola Tesla is an apostle of Alternating Current (and rightly thinks it to be superior to Direct Current), and is under immense pressure imparted by Thomas Edison (ruthless advocator of Direct Current) and his men, who are after Tesla. As Edison's men close in on him, Tesla runs out of time and hence funds for his research and is forced to oblige Angier, who is his very last client. Tesla flees the scene shortly after fulfilling his promise to Angier (not without leaving him a strong note of caution against the use of his invention), whose ever increasing skepticism in Tesla is placated by the efficacy of his masterful invention. Using Tesla's machine, Angier introduces his own version of \"The Transported Man\", which becomes an instant success, but in lieu of a terrible self-sacrifice (that Angier has to make every night while performing). As the story culminates, the viewer is startled with many revelations including the mental and physical torments that Borden's complex character undergoes owing to his total devotion towards his art.<br/><br/>The success of an act of illusion solely depends upon the deftness with which its three parts viz. the Pledge, the Turn, and the Prestige are performed. Similarly, for a movie to be a success, its three main aspects i.e. screenplay, direction, and acting are ought to be top-notch. Christopher Nolan incredibly manages to strike all the right cords with The Prestige. His riveting maneuvers coupled with his ingenious auteur skills aggrandize the brilliance of the movie ten-fold. Nolan succeeds in having a dream assemblage of actors with almost everyone giving a memorable performance. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are superb in their lead roles. Michael Caine shines in his low-key portrayal of Cutter, an ordinary part made to appear extraordinary through sheer brilliance; vintage Caine. David Bowie as Nikola Tesla and Andy Serkis (Gollum of LOTR) as Alley (Tesla's assistant) are stupendous in their cameos. Scarlet Johansson also manages to give a scintillating portrayal as Borden's paramour, Olivia.<br/><br/>The movie is a roller-coaster of a ride with intriguingly intertwined subplots and masterful time switching, which makes it one of a kind and an ultimate masterpiece. The uncanny feat of Nolan to manifest a motion picture, which forays the realms of Mystery, Thrill, Sci-fi and Fantasy, is truly exemplary and makes the movie a contemporary classic. The movie is a tapestry of twists and turns, which evinces its overwhelming potential to bewitch the masses and satiate even the most esoteric viewers. The questions that it incessantly asks of the viewers can only be answered after repetitive viewings, with each viewing seeking utmost attention of the viewer. The only question that I would ask of the viewer is: \"Are you watching closely?\" <br/><br/>A must watch for anyone, who has nothing against giving his mind a rigorous exercise and his body an adrenaline rush. 10/10</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I've said it before, but I'll say it again. Christopher Nolan can do no  wrong.  Teaming up again with his Batman Begins cast of Christian Bale and  Michael Caine, and joined with the Scoop team consisting of X-Men's  Wolverinie Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson, the stellar (eye candy)  cast already set tongues wagging as to whether they'll be able to live  up to the hype of Nolan's long awaited movie directly challenging the  other picture about Victorian magicians, The Illusionist.  The Prestige is the third act of any magic trick, with the first and  second acts being the Pledge and the Turn. And this movie lives up to  its namesake to a T. The way the movie plays out, it's like a huge  magic trick, with the audience waiting to see how it unfolds, getting  the suspicion on how it's done, but yet sitting through it thorough  engaged to discover how everything will be revealed and resolved. It  tells the story of how two magicians, fellow apprentices turned  unfortunate rivals, plod down the slow path of jealous obsession,  revenge, and the deliberate attempts to go at lengths to steal each  other's ideas, to go one up against the other, a fight in romance, life  and the long held passionate drive to discredit each other. There are  perfect explanations of the value of secrets, and how secrets can  sometimes be used as tools for deceit.  What I thought was valuable in the movie was the reinforcement of the  notion of how \"magic\" actually worked. Besides the better understanding  of the common body of scientific knowledge, things like having pretty  assistants to distract, and having planted staff amongst the audience,  somehow made me a sceptic to tricks and illusions, and try harder to  spot at which stage had things undergone a sleight of hand. More  importantly, it introduced me to the notion and importance of a loyal  engineer behind the scenes who designs elaborate contraptions solely  for the magician's use, and how having disloyal staff can indeed be  detrimental to any leaks of secrets.  And Michael Caine took on this engineering role as Cutter, responsible  for assisting Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) with loyalty and conviction  that they could, as a team, beat Christian Bale's Alfred Borden. I  thought the cast in general were superb, with Christian Bale leading  the charge. Hugh Jackman too showed that he could play a dark  character, as the two leads tackled their characters' theme of  sacrifice, arrogance, and ultimately redemption, especially for Rupert  Angier. I thought he did what he did towards the end was a kind of  penance to what happened in the beginning, hoping to kill two birds  with a single stone, to exact the sweetest revenge he could possibly  muster. What also was intriguing about the two lead characters was that  there is no right or wrong, no hero or villain. It's always a shade of  grey in what they do, and for Alfred Borden, I felt it's more for  survival and the provision for family, which is a strong subplot  running through the film. I just have to mention though, that Scarlett  Johansson being Esquire's Sexiest Woman Alive, gets to play a flower  vase role here as a magician's assistant, though her role as the pawn  between the rivals added a little gravitas.  The atmosphere was set up great, and so were the costumes and sets. The  soundtrack was hauntingly mesmerizing, capturing the look and mood  appropriately. Look out too for David Bowie's appearance as a Serbian  scientist!   I was floored by the deftness of how Nolan weaved and juxtaposed the  non linear narrative so flawlessly. While the usual techniques is to  use placeholders, or flashback sequences, colours etc, here, time is so  fluid, but yet the audience will know precisely which era they're in,  without being explicitly told, or working too much of the noodle. You  just know, and it's just that feeling of being totally transparent with  time. Even though the movie clocked in at slightly more than 2 hours,  you don't feel its length at all.  At the end of the movie, one quote popped into mind: Misdirection -  what the eyes see and the ears hear, the mind believes. Quite apt to  describe how things work out during the movie, or to describe in  general, Nolan 's films so far. That added richness to lift the movie  to a superior plane. Do yourself a favour, if there's one movie you  absolutely must watch this week, then Prestige must be your natural  choice. It's smart in delivery and slick in presentation. There is none  other.  P.S. Is it just me, or are notebooks a common feature in Nolan's  movies?</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Leaving the theater, I thought the film was just okay. An hour later, I thought it was pretty clever. And now, the next day, I think it was amazing. Why the change? It took that long for most or all of the subtle hints to sink in and the real twists to be discovered. The film doesn't end when you leave, it begins.<br/><br/>The story is the tale of two magicians in a bitter rivalry, always trying to do a better trick than the other and trying to sabotage the other's success. At least, that's what you think the story is until you finally see \"the prestige\".<br/><br/>I can't discuss much of this film because giving almost anything at all away would ruin some of the fun. But a few notes: Christian Bale, as always is awesome. An incredible actor with a wide range and screen appeal. Christopher Nolan works well with him (see \"Batman Begins\") and I hope they continue this Burton-Depp relationship they have. I foresee only greatness.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is also spectacular, probably giving the most diverse performance in the film, easily the most demanding. And he does this convincingly.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johannson is Scarlett Johannson... if you've liked her before, you should like her here (though her role never really gets the full story it needs). And David Bowie... wow, he is so much better than \"Labrynth\" would have you believe.<br/><br/>The visuals are stunning, but the real credit goes to the makeup department, who deserve an Oscar for this picture. Outside of horror films where extensive makeup is often required, this film probably does more to change the actors' appearances than any other film I've ever seen. And I was going along with the ride the whole time.<br/><br/>If you see one film from 2006, see \"The Departed\". But if you see two, \"The Prestige\" better be on your list.</div>\n",

The acting performances by Hugh  Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine were the best I have see in  a long while. The only objection I had to the film was that it was a  little long, but once you leave the theater you will discuss the film  and it many twists and turns. My wife and myself discussed it all the  way home from the movie theater. This is a winner and should be up for  some academy award statues, and my recommendation is go see this as  soon as you can, you will not be disappointed.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">In the filmmakers' minds. Instead, it became one of the finest films of the year 2006. \"The Prestige\" is a perfect example of what a movie should be like if it does not rely on you liking and cheering for the central characters. Neither Angier (Jackman), nor Borden (Bale) are likable characters at all. And yet you are completely under their spell as this film goes on. This may be a bit of a subjective take as I quite like Hugh Jackman and find Bale a joy to watch most of the time as well. And Johansson and Hall are among my favorite actresses as well. But it's not only the cast that makes it so much worth watching. It's also the visual side. Art direction, set decoration, cinematography and costumes are top-notch and even the rare special effects are pretty nice. The film managed two Academy Award nominations for its visual side, both of them very deserved and I actually would not have minded if it had won one of these over \"Pan's Labyrinth\".<br/><br/>The film's director is Christopher Nolan and he also wrote the movie together with his brother after the first Batman film. He also cast some of the actors from his superhero trilogy, including Bale and Caine, the only one who didn't do that much for me. Now back to Nolan's script: I think this is probably the heart and soul of the film. Such love to detail, so much suspense, so many surprises and all these great scenes like the doppelgänger parts or the suicide of Hall's character in the room with all the birds, which were actually the way how he met her when he talked to her nephew. Very very smart screenplay. All in all, the best thing about it, however, is how he wrote the two protagonists and their egos constantly clashing with each other, maybe because they weren't so different after all. Of course, Jackman and Bale give great performances too and that is why it worked so well, but still you cannot appreciate Nolan's effort enough. And his brother's. Lets not forget about him. People say, Nolan has problems when it comes to directing and writing realistic female characters, but I disagree. He managed in this film without a doubt and he also managed in others. When the two magicians fight each other or I should probably say get their hands dirty, literally everybody else in this film is constantly affected: their women, their assistants, their set creators...<br/><br/>The accidental death of one character's wife sets off a deadly spiral which results in murder in the end. Or does it really? Nothing in this film is what it seems and we do not only get one major plot twist in the end, but two. Apart from that, the progress in terms of inventions and electricity also brings a completely new dimension of progress for the profession of a magician, actually for life in general, for everybody. So, we also get some interesting references on Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison. I also liked how Nolan revealed some tricks, but not all of them, so the movie itself stays a bit of a mystery still. This was the second time I watched this film and it was as good as the first. I highly recommend watching the almost 10-year-old, 120 minute-long \"The Prestige\". It's possibly my favorite Christopher Nolan movie.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I thought this was an amazing film. It takes a period before the advent of the illusionist pyrotechnics of modern times and shows us the magic. Not only does it have the magic working for it, it has a great story of revenge, hatred, one-upsmanship, genius, you name it. The story teaches us about illusion which is a much more accurate term for what we see. I will never look at David Copperfield the same way again. There is incredible scenic effluence. The acting is impeccable and the direction and cinematography is unrivaled. For once a film that lives up to its hype. Using David Bowie as Tesla is marvelous. I've always thought that he should have had a much greater career as an actor than he has realized. Michael Caine is the voice of reason, but his voice is seldom listened to. Revenge is one of the oldest motives and it poisons one of the characters. Stay with this one; then see it again. It is a masterpiece.</div>\n",

Due to hubris, Julia is killed in one of the tricks. It sets off a combative obsessive competition between Angier and Borden that ends in their eventual destruction. Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson play other love interests.<br/><br/>This is a dense complicated plot. If you figured it out before the ending, then you're much smarter than me. Christopher Nolan and his brother have woven an intrigue story of obsession and revenge. The twists will leave you stunned. The reveals of the tricks are jaw dropping. It doesn't get more mind bending than this one.<br/><br/>In a way, the flashforwards are not that necessary. It throws a complicated story into more confusion. It's too much. The movie may be better to be more straight forward. Personally, I like the challenge.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Director Christopher Nolan has a proclivity for warped narratives (Memento) and in The Prestige he serves up a deliciously twisty tale, puffed full of magic theatricality and inventive cinematic devices. With his remarkably sleight-of-hand direction, he spins the tale of two rivaling magicians in Victorian-era London, creating a cerebrally stimulating 2 hour long mise-en-scene in which the audience is literally left guessing and gasping at its rare uniqueness through magic acts and bitter behind-the-stage intrigue.<br/><br/>The final pay-off of any magic act  the prestige  is of the essence, and preluding it is the pledge, followed by the turn. Together these three key components are slotted in unique positions in 'The Prestige's arrestingly clever script but it is the titular act that propels the film. The pledge introduces our main characters: magicians Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) in turn-of-the-century London and we see how their friendship abruptly becomes a fully-fledged rivalry and hostility with a magic act gone horribly wrong in front of an audience. There is a death, and it lights the fuse of an onslaught of reel revelations and the one-upmanship that will ensue between the two competitors. 'The turn' comes to offers twists by the bucketload in the form of love-interests, and technologically marvelous magic acts. I gasped, I scratched my head, I watched on in awe. No description will do it justice.<br/><br/>The prestige as the end note to the show  in which, for example, the disappearer reappears to the deafening applause of the crowd  is so meticulously composed in the film through foreshadowing and fractured chronology that rigorously intersects, intertwines, intercuts, fast-forwards, rewinds and replays key parts of the story that the whole spectacle floors you. Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan have worked out a template script that is more twisty and turny than a mountain road and for that reason I am very reluctant to spoil even the slightest detail of the story of 'The Prestige' of all of its acts, in fact. If you are shaking your head thinking a clever twist ending does not make the movie (and I agree), know that this is not a \"gotcha\"-kind of Shyamalan trick where you want to stop the film, rewind it and watch it meticulous foreshadowing up to the cheap pay-off, but a tightly-written ever-shifting hall of mirrors with so many intrinsic twists that on your way home you will still be scratching you head and searching for clues.<br/><br/>Our two magicians are perfectly-cast with Hugh Jackman capturing the showy, slick, ambition-driven nature of his character Angier in contrast to Bale's technique-driven purist who may be well on his way to perfecting the craft, but lacks the 'Abracadabra' entertainment value. I had always crowned the latter the more capable actor of the two, but the fact is that Jackman performs just as well in the film. Having said that, Borden has more layers to his complex, contradictory (keyword) persona than the flashy, greedy Angier which perhaps begs more weight from the actor behind the role, shifting more demand on Christian Bale. The sad fact of it is that neither of these two men are likable characters and elicit nothing more than temporary sympathy. However, the secrecy with which the intricate story approaches them makes it impossible for the viewer to slot them in protagonist vs. antagonist positions, and indeed they are given almost the exact same screen-time and voice-over narration throughout, a subtle and brilliant accolade of Nolan's.<br/><br/>To further evaluate the cast of The Prestige, David Bowie and Michael Caine undoubtedly merit a great deal of praise for supporting the two moody, unlikeable leading men. It is a crying shame then that Scarlett Johansson  always an incapable actress except for the rare occasions in which she plays a sultry American vixen (Match Point)  performs so badly in the role of Olivia Wenscombe, a magic assistant pending between Borden and Angier. Here she is actually given a very good and important character who is not necessarily bad like the rest, but botches her interpretation by giving an unspeakably hammy London accent. Nolan picks up on her shortcomings as an actress, and resorts to boob-shots en masse. This he should be fully entitled to do as a director, for a beautiful diversion will always camouflage the process and any of its potential missteps, as Michael Caine's character puts forward.<br/><br/>With Scarlett as a pleasurable paint-job, twists by the bucket-load and flashy magic tricks as windowdressing to a solid mystery film, there is little or no need to delve deeper into the psyches of its characters to keep our attention. Yet this is done, and superbly so, by Christopher Nolan. 'Antihero' gets a whole new spin to it in The Prestige with two friends-turned-rivals so bitterly poised on the brink of obsession of outshining the other that succeeding with the ultimate 'prestige' of magic followed by applause is enough to drive them to murder, bankruptcy, deceit and sabotage. Borden simply wants to be better on a technical level, while Angier wants the public's recognition and wide-spread fame. Their ambition is in effect largely the same: create the definitive deceptive illusion and do it through any means necessary.<br/><br/>'The Prestige' is a majestic film that nevertheless spans across too long a running time. Condensation would have done wonders and surely bumped it up a notch, as would underpinning some humour at one or two points (it is VERY gloomy), but it truly is a great cinematic achievement and a shoe-in for my top 10 of 1006, and easily the most inventive film I have seen in years. I am eagerly anticipated director Christopher Nolan's next sleight-of-hand direction, and it looks like the closest is The Dark Knight (2008).<br/><br/>9 out of 10</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The Prestige is a masterful exercise in storytelling with superb direction and powerful performances by a grand ensemble cast. From set and production design to cinematography, from script to presentation, Christopher Nolan has once again demonstrated why he is one of the film world's brightest up and coming directors. The Prestige only helps solidify his standing as one of the landmark directors of his generation.<br/><br/>Told in a narrative that jumps between various points along its time line, playing out like a magic act itself, the story is that of two magicians on the rise in their careers. The first -- played by Christian Bale -- is an expert in understanding the fundamentals of any trick, but lacks showmanship. The second -- played by Hugh Jackman -- is a master showman who is more entertaining than technical. A tragic series of events pits the two performers against each other in a battle of wits that spirals further and further out of control, consuming both of them and everything and everyone they care about.<br/><br/>With a story that requires actors with a great deal of emotive range, Nolan has assembled what could be described as a dream cast. Both Bale and Jackman suit their respective roles perfectly, and pitting these two performers against each other was a stroke of casting genius. Michael Caine takes what could have been a forgettable role by any lesser actor and elevates it with his demanding screen presence. Probably the most surprising performance comes from David Bowie whose unforgettable turn as master physicist Nikola Tesla absolutely shines. Add Andy Serkis to the mix, and what is assembled is a group of performers who know how to fully engage the audience.<br/><br/>The Prestige is hard to pigeonhole into any specific genre as it walks the fine line between mystery, drama, suspense and fantasy. In that, the story becomes a never-ending stream of wonder for the mind: one can never tell exactly where the story is going to lead next, becoming more and more as time goes on. This gives Christopher Nolan ample opportunity to play. And play he does. With narration by several characters, each adding their own viewpoint to the events, and with a direction that moves between time to mystify and distract, the end result is a climax that itself is a series of puzzles that each unravel beautifully.<br/><br/>The only major criticisms that can be leveled at the Prestige are a confusing play with the seasons during Tesla's introduction (winter suddenly becomes spring/summer and back again) and a strange choice of music for the closing credits (a pop song at the end of a film such as this seems tacky). However, neither is significant enough of a problem to warrant any need to avoid the film at all.<br/><br/>In the end, the Prestige is a fantastic display of what can be accomplished when you bring together superior talent. It is certainly worth the price of admission and as good as any magic show you are to come across.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">What \"The Prestige\" does very well is recreate a period of show business history near the turn of the century in which competition between magicians was serious and intense. The workings of the complicated illusions are gorgeously brought to life via smartly detailed apparatus that replicate the actual mechanics of Victorian legerdemain. <br/><br/>Much of the film rings very true, such as the all-consuming obsessions of the lead characters to be the best and outdo all others. It's an easy step to accept that such unwavering determination spills over into deadly territory, as rival magicians suave Rupert Angier (a riveting performance by Hugh Jackman) and audacious Alfred Borden (Christian Bale effortlessly playing a brooding lower-class Brit) each seek to wreak continuing revenge upon the other.<br/><br/>The story, though adapted from a novel, feels like a perfect fit for director Nolan's sensibilities, as the machinations of the two men become increasingly convoluted during a back-and-forth tug of wits that keeps you guessing in the style of Nolan's \"Memento.\" As the game grows increasingly deadly, and threatens to consume all they love, the film becomes a fascinating study in single-mindedness.<br/><br/>The work is epic in sweep, beautifully filmed, and strongly acted. The only odd note in casting is David Bowie as Nikola Tesla (he looks nothing like the actual Tesla, if you care about these sort of things, and his appearance calls attention to itself as superstar casting often does), but Mr. Bowie holds his own. Solid performances are all around, with Michael Caine adding dignity and depth as the old master, Scarlett Johanssen as the as the lovely stage assistant who becomes the third point in a twisted love triangle, and even Andy Serkis (Gollum!) in a memorable supporting role.<br/><br/>The introduction of Tesla adds yet another twist, as the film shifts from real-but-possible stage illusion to steam-punkish sci-fi. This transition is a hard note to pull off, since the beginning of the film doesn't quite suggest such a direction, but if you're willing to let Nolan lead you on the journey into increasingly fantastic realms, the narrative rewards you with thought-provoking moral and dramatic exploration of the issues raised.<br/><br/>A truly entertaining movie, and an original, unusual, dark ride -- well worth seeing in a theater for its grand scope and vision.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">In between the Batman movies, Christopher Nolan cast Christian Bale and Michael Caine in \"The Prestige\". It tells the story of magicians Alfred Borden (Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman). Initially partners, they had a falling out and became rivals. From there the movie becomes a battle of wits, showing how the men have no aim except to destroy the other. Caine plays John Cutter, the state engineer who works for Angier.<br/><br/>I notice similarities between this movie and some of Nolan's others. There's the non-linear plot, like \"Memento\"; one-upmanship, like \"Insomnia\"; the question of morality, like in \"The Dark Knight\". But what impressed me more than anything was all the stuff about magic tricks, how the characters use the tricks against each other, and how they both use Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson). Angier's and Borden's rivalry mirrors Nikola Tesla's (David Bowie) rivalry with Thomas Edison.<br/><br/>All in all, I recommend this movie. It's both a look into the world of magic tricks, and also the dangers of obsession with revenge. Also starring Andy Serkis (Gollum in the LOTR movies) and Ricky Jay (a real-life magician).<br/><br/>PS: other 2006 movies dealing with magic tricks are \"The Illusionist\" and \"Scoop\" (also starring Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson).</div>\n",

A unique plot with an amazing cast--any of whom could believably garner an Oscar nomination. Christian Bale was amazing in one of his rare cockney performances. We already know from Kate and Leopold how well Hugh Jackman plays a distinguished English gent. He's absolutely priceless. Is there any point in discussing Sir Michael Caine? He brings polish to the movie. <br/><br/>This is the kind of flick that you can discuss for weeks after. The plot is so detailed and complete and open to interpretation. My friend and I have been discussing various nuances of this film for the past 3 weeks. It definitely stays with you.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">There are many kinds of magic: wizardry à la 'Harry Potter', illusions or hallucinations, or entertaining shows: mediums, rabbits in top-hats, women sawed in half, bag-content guessing, magic cards etc. <br/><br/>Speaking of cards, Christopher Nolan's \"Prestige\", made between two 'Batman' movies, lays its cards at the first voice-over monologue where we immediately recognize Michael Caine's smooth voice. It's about the third kind of magic and provides the three structural rules of an act: it starts with the Pledge: you show something normal then the Turn, you make it do something extraordinary... but there's an element of expectation and the higher your reputation goes, the more sophisticated the public. In fact, there's got to be something unpredictable, so it all comes down to the Prestige, the trick no one sees coming and will earn magicians applauses and guess what? prestige.<br/><br/>Then, the least you can expect from the film is to follow these three rules even in the loosest possible way if it means wowing you with a spectacular surprise. And given that it's a Nolan film about the deadly art of illusion, much more opening with the killing of a magician, the imprisonment of his rival whom everything accuses, your twist-radar is set from the start, so not any twist will do. Whatever the prestige will be, if it's not venturing in the realm of feasibility, something will have been missed. We're dealing with magic after all, not fantasy, not sci-fi. I insist on the sci-fi element because the film opens with some electrical contraption that shakes its credibility from the start until a reassuring trap door shows and we can let a sight of relief go.<br/><br/>French called electricity a Fairy so it all makes sense that magicians would use it as a device for generating illusion, just like rivals Edison and Tesla were perceived as wizards. After all, it's also established that magic is about what you see and what you don't and the use of lights and darkness is integral to the act. Still, I didn't like that machine. It felt incongruous and weird in a period drama and I was afraid Nolan would end up inserting some Batman-like device. And when he said in the \"making of\" video that he wanted to portray magic according to his personal vision of film-making, I thought \"no kidding?\", I'm pretty sure everyone got the parallel, especially when magical acts use special effects worthy of a Spielberg film. <br/><br/>So Nolan gets a little carried away at the end while the first two acts of the movie had really gotten me involved, I mean the escalating rivalry between the two magicians Alfred Bowden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and their attempts to destroy one's act or find one's secret. What Nolan got right is that the rivalry mostly works as a foil to plunge us in the world of magic and know all the tricks. After all, that's the greatest thrill about magic, seeing how it works. For instance, the way a magician puts a dove in a cage and then flattens it to magically making the dove reappear under a handkerchief always made me scratch my head... but in this Dickensian universe where there's no pity for little children, why should there for innocent animals?<br/><br/>The trigger of the rivalry also helps to understand how one of the most famous magic tricks, the \"escape from the tank water\" that made Houdini's reputation, is indirectly explained. Working as false audience members, Bowden and Angier are assigned to tie the magician's pretty assistant (Piper Perabo), one of them makes the kind of knot that doesn't leave any chance for the poor girl, who happens to be the other's wife. We gather that from then, it's personal. Another pivotal moment occurs when one conceives his masterpiece, an act that consists on getting in a door and coming out of another. He calls it \"The Transported Man\", for us, it looks like teleportation and it justifies why the rival is devoured by jealousy, although Caine's character can only see one explanation: there must be a double.<br/><br/>At that point of the review, it's impossible to go further without spoiling the film. It's engaging enough to make you forget there's a twist but it's not spoiling the film to say that there's a twist, since it's the essence of magic. You've got to wow the audience with a surprise at the end. With the seemingly death of a character right at the start of the film, the battle to know everyone's tricks and the existence of a double, anyone could reassemble the pieces of the puzzle. But you know Nolan has more than a trick in his sleeve and that's both a blessing and a curse. Granted anticipations are to be toyed a little to be emotionally rewarded, all he had to do was working on the narrative structure to make what we know first a more effective reveal or a shock.<br/><br/>Instead of that, Nolan relied on a far fetched revelation combined with an implementation that destroyed the whole atmosphere built throughout the film. From the start, we follow magicians who are dedicated to their passion, which is good, but the escalation toward sadism and some ends-justifying-the-means means made their whole approach to their art debatable, leaving no room for sympathy. In this cruel battle of wits, women are reduced to disposable pawns (Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johannsen would get more dimensional roles in a certain Woody Allen's movie). <br/><br/>The first two acts, we can call them 'pledges' and 'turns' are great but then the film goes downhill. One thing for sure, I hated that Tesla Machine, and no offense to David Bowie, but Tesla was quite a handsome fellow whom I doubt spoke with such a heavy British accent. Nolan wanted his film-making to echo magic, but he let the reverse thing operate.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">In the end of the Nineteenth Century, in London, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), his beloved wife Julia McCullough (Piper Perabo) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are friends and assistants of a magician. When Julia accidentally dies during a performance, Robert blames Alfred for her death and they become enemies. Both become famous and rival magicians, sabotaging the performance of the other on the stage. When Alfred performs a successful trick, Robert becomes obsessed trying to disclose the secret of his competitor with tragic consequences.<br/><br/>\"The Prestige\" is a great tale of rivalry, obsession, revenge and sacrifice. The unpredictable screenplay has many twists, disclosing unusual situations and hooking the attention of the viewer until the very last scene. Christopher Nolan, after the masterpiece \"Memento\", offers another excellent movie for the cinema lovers, better and better than the Oscar winner \"The Departed\". The amazing dispute between the outstanding Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman is supported by the extraordinary Michael Caine and a wonderful cinematography. My vote is nine.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): \"O Grande Truque\" (\"The Great Trick\")</div>\n",

The Prestige is a masterful exercise in storytelling with superb direction and powerful performances. I was floored by the deftness of how Nolan weaved and juxtaposed the non linear narrative so flawlessly. What makes this movie so incredible is that while it is indeed a movie about magicians (or illusionists) it is also a complex character study about how self destructive obsessions are with a sideline love story and a sci-fi twist - very unique.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Oh man, this one had me right up to the part with the transporter/duplicator machine. Until then it was a compelling and complex tale dealing in murder, mystery and intrigue with a clever backdrop of magicians attempting to outdo each other with the grandest illusion of all time. What I'm not going to do is go back and watch this three times in a row like I did with \"Memento\" because when all is said and done, I won't be any better off. In a way I felt cheated that an 1880's era film would bring in a fictional sci-fi element the way it did. It seems to me the story could have gotten around that contrivance to come up with a more realistic resolution that confined itself to existing science and techniques of illusion. Then, when Borden (Christian Bale) had his final showdown with Angier (Hugh Jackman), he could have caught the bullet to end the picture on a more promising note. I don't really mean to sound so harsh on the film because like I said, up to the Tesla part this story was going great guns. Maybe because the guy portraying Tesla looked so much like David Bowie, it kept me off stride for a while as well. Then it turned out to be Bowie when the credits rolled, and I was back to thinking about that business with the cats and the hats. Maybe the whole thing was an illusion.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">... but I guess that is really beside the point.<br/><br/>Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play two young British magicians - Alfred Borden and Robert Angier - trying to learn the tricks of the trade, somewhat even allied at first. Borden is a common Londoner, but Angier is to the manor born, using an alias in his magic work so as to not to embarrass his rich Victorian family. In the pursuit of a more fantastic trick a terrible accident occurs and Angier loses somebody close to him, vowing revenge against Borden, whom he holds responsible.<br/><br/>These two are both the Roadrunner and Wiley Coyote to one another. Each one tries to sabotage and learn the other's tricks, make each other look\n",
      "ridiculous, etc. Angier is the more dangerous of the two because he is truly intent on killing Borden when he infiltrates his \"catch the bullet\" act early on in the film and, instead, maims him. The rivalry ratchets up\n",
      "to increasingly dangerous proportions. It is ultimately a fine piece of drama as to how far these two are willing to go in their obsession and for their art, with them both ultimately living tragic and miserable lives in the process. So much sacrifice for what most people would consider a trivial pastime. It is madness beyond obsession.<br/><br/>This is a very entertaining and thought provoking film, and there is plenty of foreshadowing. Watch closely and watch it twice. I honestly don't think Christopher Nolan would be capable of linear storytelling if his life depended on it, but he is a master of this adapted material. At the end I could only go - \"Brilliant\".<br/><br/>Scarlett Johannson plays Angier's lover who has a pivotal role in how the final act plays out. Rebecca Hall is Sarah, Borden's wife, who can't figure out why her husband seems to only love her on some days. David Bowie lends a real air of mystery to his portrayal of Nikola Tesla. But who else but Bowie could believably introduce his character by walking through lightning? Yes, the Tesla-Edison feud gets incorporated into the film and even a sci-fi angle is thrown into the plot. Michael Caine, as Jackman's magician mentor, seems to be playing his Alfred character from The Dark Knight. He has a supporting role, but watch him carefully, he has some of the most important lines of the film. And his final decision - do you think it was correct? Did two wrongs make a right in this unique situation?<br/><br/>I wish I could tell you more, but I would give away the plot if I did. This is truly one of the better films made in the 21st century, and I largely don't like films made after 1960. Highly recommended and a real head scratcher, especially given the last line of the film.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This movie is very engaging and intriguing. You are presented with a complete mess of scenes which go back and forth through time and are needlessly confusing, yet the core story and the characters were compelling enough to keep me interested and paying attention. The cinematography, the sound, the acting, and the visual elements are all perfectly in place, and overall its very entertaining.<br/><br/>My only concern is that the film prevents itself from achieving greatness by relying heavily on a very cheap, shallow plot element. It becomes science fiction, which is fine but a bit strange after spending so long convincing me the characters are real. This is something I find with all of Nolan's movies, that they present themselves as being mysterious and secretive but fall a little flat if you apply any brain power to them.<br/><br/>Still, I think this movie is worth watching if you're looking for something a little suspenseful, a little creepy, and very entertaining. Maybe the movie's ultimate goal is the same as a magician's, as said in the movie: that one moment where the audience is in awe and disbelief.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This is certainly a consensus pick as one of the worst (if not the worst) movies ever made - and for that very reason I've always wanted to watch it. Now I have, and my suggestion to everyone is - lighten up. Yes, it's bad. The sets are dreadful - worse than you used to see on Saturday morning kids' shows. The special effects are weak - although to be honest I've seen worse portrayals of space flight. And the costumes are hilarious - especially the polar bear and the robot. But come on - you have to admit that there's a certain \"cuteness\" to the story of Martians coming to earth to kidnap Santa Claus so that he can bring happiness to their children. All the characters are pretty one- dimensional. There's good guys and bad guys and fun guys and kids from both Earth and Mars. No one gets particularly well developed. And then, of course, there's Santa. In all honesty, I thought John Call did a decent job as the jolly old man. In this age of high tech special effects and big budget movies there's no doubt that this looks pretty weak - and even by the standards of 1964 it was still pretty weak. But it's good fun, and for the fun alone I don't think it deserves its reputation as one of the worst movies ever. What's left to say, except - \"Hurray for Santy Claus!\" 4/10</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is a low budget kid's movie from the early 60's. It has a reputation as one of the worst movies ever made. But, similar to most such famously trashed films, it actually turns out to be nowhere near the worst of the worst. More accurately, this could be described as an enjoyable slice of cheese. Sure, its rubbish on several levels but it also happens to be memorable on several other levels.<br/><br/>The story, such as it is, has the Martians kidnapping Santa Claus and, in the process, abducting two Earth children as well. You see, the Martians want to enjoy Christmas as well. With a plot-line as moronic as that, there's really no point in splitting hairs over details and instead just sit back and watch what unfolds. The sets, costumes and make-up are all bargain-basement but they all work well enough within the confines of the plastic coated world that they exist in. Some of the highlights of the film as a whole include an angry Martian and friendly but stupid Martian, an impressively unconvincing and fake polar bear, a comedy punch up and last, yet surely best of all, a truly infectious theme song about Santy Claus. In the final analysis, there's enough strangeness here to qualify this as a bona fide cult item. It's poor, yet simultaneously quite good. Come on now; let's hear it for Santy Claus!</div>\n",

I'll leave that for you. At least they opted not to make Santa a Kung Fu Master, it's all meant to be heart warming.<br/><br/>Could I sit through it again?

NOW WHEN ITS A POSITIVE REVIEW THAT TELLS ME THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE MOVIE. IF ITS A NEGATIVE REVIEW THEN THEY MIGHT HAVE A GRUDGE AGAINST THE FILM . NOW I HAVE REVIEWED OVER 200 HOLIDAY FILMS. I HAVE NO AGENDA. I AM HONEST<br/><br/>Growing up in Oxnard Ca this film always played on KTTV Channel 11 around Christmas time. It later moved to KTLA Channel 5 and Pia Zadora even did a fireside chat with television movie host Tom Hatten. <br/><br/>Even today watching this film is a huge part of my \"Christmas traditions\". It was a \"Must See\" when I was a child and today I still watch it (Around Christmas)\". I also still watch \"Rudolph\" \"Charlie Brown\" \"Frosty the Snowman\" and MGM's \"A Christmas Carol\". One of the main reasons why I love this film is because I loved John Call as \"Santa Claus\". He is a huge delight. He is a terrific Santa. <br/><br/>In this film \"Santa\" gets kidnapped by Martians. The reason is that the children of Mars do not have a \"Santa\". They also do not know how to have \"fun\". So the leader of Mars goes to Earth and kidnaps Santa as well as 2 earth children. \"Santa\" then slowly wins over the Adult Martians even though there are certain forces against him. <br/><br/>Now if you are an adult (and you have never seen this) you will think this movie is terrible. Children (Who still believe in Santa) will be entertained. It is harmless fun! Even the theme song \"Hooray For Santa Claus\" is \"Cute &amp; Catchy\".<br/><br/>The films low budget is all too apparent here however if this film did have a bigger budget then it might not have the weird charm.<br/><br/>I beg all of you to watch this film. Have a viewing party. It is a film that many people have seen and actually are afraid to admit that they enjoy it. <br/><br/>I am not afraid to admit that I even bought this film on Blu-Ray.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Maybe I have a soft spot somewhere in my heart for poorly written, badly conceived, silly 1960s children's movies - but I really can't understand why Santa Claus versus the Martians is in the worst 100 movies of all time here on IMDb. Sure, most viewers will breathe a sigh of relief when it ends, but this film really seems downright harmless compared to the six month old Kennel Ration Hollywood has been feeding us as commercial film for the last ten or so years. Hey, at least it's not a remake, a sequel, or a 2 hour long CGI cartoon with a few human faces tossed in for effect.<br/><br/>Santa Claus gets kidnapped by distraught martians (white guys with bad green makeup and a few dishwasher parts glued to their heads, as well as inexplicable capes), who want to rescue their depressive, antisocial children from the doldrums by giving them all toys and a big red-suited guy with a beard to laugh at... err... with. Santa adapts to life on Mars very well and starts cranking out the toys with the help of Martian machines, but political controversies surrounding his activities soon threaten the fabric of Martian Society.<br/><br/>I'm not kidding.... really.... this is the plot.<br/><br/>Aside from the ludicrous plot and mediocre acting (Bill McCutcheon gives the only really enjoyable performance in this film, though Pia Zadora and Vincent Beck are not too bad), this is no worse than many of the kid films of its time. In the age of ADD and general impatience, however, this film is more than a little dated. The only modern kid I can imagine enjoying this film is one with an extraordinarily great attention span and a penchant for B-films. In terms of production, this film has the feel of a 2 hour, 1960s low budget TV show, and is almost as clever.<br/><br/>I would recommend avoiding this film unless you're compelled to watch films which go to extremes. I found it cute, funny, and more than a tad ridiculous. To most people, it's a film version of your great Aunt's wallpaper - it's just there on the TV, while far more interesting things are happening in the carpet below your feet.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I really enjoy this silly little holiday flick. A bunch of serious Martian adults are afraid that their serious Martian children are too serious, so they go to a serious Martian senior citizen. The old guy tells them that the children need to be taught how to laugh, and then he explodes for no reason. The only logical thing left to do, of course, is go to Earth and kidnap Santa Claus, who we meet as he is being interviewed by the Rip Taylor-like Andy Anderson. I liked how in the movie's universe, Santa is unquestionably real and everyone knows about him. He really does deliver toys to everyone, toys made by a dozen elves (who all look like they're suffering from mini-seasonal depression). One toy shown is a toy rocket that runs on \"real rocket fuel\", Santa proudly explains. I would ask, \"Where do little kids get rocket fuel?\" The details of Santa's amazingly speedy mass distribution methods are not brought up, but it's probably black magic-related.<br/><br/>The Martians nab Kris Kringle and two little Earth children, who seem to live alone in the woods with no parents or family but are clean and well fed. The Martian leader forces Santa and the children to run their soulless toy machine (Soulless Toy Machine would be a good name for a band). Despite the numerous violations of human rights, it's all in good fun and everybody is nice and happy, except for one mean Martian (with a disturbing droopy mustache and a sidekick that looks like Jamie Farr) who plots to kidnap Santa (even though he's already been kidnapped). Santa encourages the kids, even the Martian kids who have now learned to have fun, to hurl lots of heavy mid-sixties toys at the bad guy's skulls. Through this display of parental negligence and bad music the evil is thwarted, and Santa is permitted to go back to Earth, letting the mewling half-wit comic relief Martian named Droppo take over the reigns of the Martian Toy Empire. (The Martians are out-of-shape guys in tights and helmets with antenna sprouting out of them, and what looks like diarrhea smeared across their faces. Imagine a guy dressed like that mugging worse than the teacher guy in Juan Piquor Simon's \"Monster Island\" and that's Droppo).<br/><br/>How can you hate this movie? If I were a little kid in 1964 I'd be enthralled. They packed this movie with nutty stuff. Elves get shot with freeze rays. Mrs. Claus is a frantic goofball. The Martian children sleep under strange lights and eat only pills. The bad guy's hideout looks like that one King Crimson album cover.  I loved the part where the villain tries to shoot Santa and the kids out of an airlock, and the part where the bad guys meddle with the toy machine and the toys come out all mixed-up. There's a guy in a goofy robot costume, and a guy in an even goofier polar bear costume. And that deliciously idiotic theme song- \"You spell it S-A-N-T-A C-L-A-U-S, Hooray for Santy Claus!\" Oh, it's so good!<br/><br/>I sincerely feel the people making this had the best intentions, and while they didn't have a huge budget they made a fun, silly kids movie. If it was the same exact movie but done in Rudolf-style stop motion animation it would be a regular holiday viewing tradition.<br/><br/>Oh, yeah, and  Pia Zadora is in this, as if anyone cares.</div>\n",

Its cult precedes it.<br/><br/>Santa Claus is a funny ,serene Sci-Fi adventure for kids. I have seen for the first time as a 29 yrs. man,and liked it.I can only guess what a fun experience might this film be for a kid. It is clumsy in a way so humble, so modest, that it's endearing. It is a nice joyride, colorful and amusing. It is cheerful ,childish and clumsy. I do not understand the sour bitter compact prejudice against it. It's not much to be said about SANTA CLAUS; what can one comment about a nice joke, or about an unpretentious fairy tale?</div>\n",

When a father goes to the supreme leader about the problems his children are having the leader tell s them that \"Children are no longer Children on Mars\". Eventually the Martians are told about how on earth they have Christmas and Santa Claus. <br/><br/>The Martians then set out to kidnap Santa and they do along with 2 children. <br/><br/>Santa however is facing a problem when he gets on Mars because one the Martians does not approve of his arrival. <br/><br/>If your a child of the 1970's then chances are you have seen this film.

They obviously had a budget of about fifty bucks to make this, and it shows.<br/><br/>But some of us love these evidences that once upon a time in America there was such a thing as real independent cinema, and all-afternoon multi-feature holiday shows at neighborhood theaters that only had one screen, and sing-along events built into kids' movies, and fun that didn't depend on multi-billion dollar special effects.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that you will laugh at and make fun of, yet long for the days when local, independent television stations aired it on a Saturday afternoon before Christmas. You'll make jokes about it, but catch yourself absentmindedly humming \"Hooray for Santy Claus!\" for the rest of your life.

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">(r#30)<br/><br/>Basically everything is wrong about this film, and that's what makes it so great. It's hysterical, but even as you're laughing yourself breathless you can't help but feel bad inside that you're actually chewing down this rotten junk food. Because that's what Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is: a case of food poisoning. There are layers and layers of awfulness in this movie, and it really is an unforgettable experience. The actors are all stoned out of their minds and extremely ugly. The title pretty much explains the plot, although there's not really a lot of \"conquering\". Maybe a better title would have been \"Santa Claus Laughs at Inappropriate Times while Hanging Out with Bad Actors in Silly Outfits\"? Just saying. I know it isn't as catchy, but at least it's not deceiving.<br/><br/>It would be impossible to sum up all the stuff that sucks about this film, so I'll break it down into what I remember most strongly: a man in an ingeniously fake-looking polar bear costume (funnier than the \"bear\" from Hercules in New York); an extra with the most unnatural laugh you're ever likely to hear; an ex-dope addict martian with tics; kid actors who make sure every syllable of their lines are slowly and caaarreee-fulll-yyy prrooo-noun-ceeed; a newspaper headline stating that Santa's been \"kidnaped\", and a giant robot. Yes, you read that right. A giant robot.<br/><br/>The worst acting job in here must be when Mother Claus and her elves have been \"frozen\" by the \"Martians'\" weapons. Could they be *more* trembling? I know this was the sixties and everyone was doped up, but still.<br/><br/>This wins the Dung Beetle Award of the year. Destined to become a Christmas classic for me!</div>\n",

Martian children have become obsessed with American TV, and apparently in possession of really good TV rabbit ears), so their fathers decide to grab earthling children and later Santa Claus for themselves. The children of earth discover the plot to kidnap Santa and decide to stop them.<br/><br/>The Martians here, wearing very tight, revealing clothing, look exactly like humans except they have green tinted skin (making me believe that the Wicked Witch of the West must have been a Martian) and felt skulls with antennas, some with moustaches and some able to laugh. There's even one who could have been the Mickey Rooney from Mars. One of the Martian children is the young Pia Zadora who would go on to become the greatest film star of the 1980's. The art direction is actually pretty interesting, but it looks closer to a 60's TV science fiction show (like \"Lost in Space\") than the serious sci-fi films of the time. Get a loaf of the fake polar bear in the north pole sequence and a giant robot that is truly laughable.<br/><br/>What makes this film really bad is the idiotic dialogue and the acting which really seems like the actors (if you can call them that) memorize the script that morning and never rehearsed before the cameras rolled. The Martians also use guns that look like they are shooting nerf balls. At least there's that zippy \"Hooray For Santa Claus!\" song for audiences to sing as they left the theater. This really seems to have been made the intentions of being cheesy, and I'm on that level, it's succeeds.</div>\n",

By making a low budget film out of it. And that's just what Joseph Levine thought when he released this film onto an unsuspecting Earth. Now I ask you, is this indeed the WORST film of all time? My opinion: NO. In my translation of the meaning \"bad film\" means \"unbearable, unwatchable and disposable.\" Not \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians.\" This film is a landmark in the American motion picture industry. The makers of this film actually had the guts to create and release this film. Now that takes some serious talent! Let's not forget the actors either. Surprisingly the acting isn't nearly as bad as it's made out to be (people confuse the 'acting' with the 'plot.'). The children, the Martians and even Santa Claus make one heck of an impression on a shoe-string budget film like this (don't forget that weird professor Albert Einstein wannabe). Above all, clever a production design really create a fine sense of cheesiness. Now, how about a brand new DVD 'Special Cheesy Edition' of \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians?\" <br/><br/>\"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\" is a rare and satisfying little gem of a film that broke, no, shattered all the rules of making a \"good and enjoyable\" movie. Now if only the bad films we get nowadays would be as bad as this one. Then they would actually be deemed \"enjoyable.\"<br/><br/>I give \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\" 5 frozen-stiff elves zapped by Voldar, out of 5.<br/><br/>A true cinematic cult classic.</div>\n",

John Call horribly overdoes the hale'n'hearty merriment as an insufferably jolly Saint Nick. Vincent Beck likewise hams it up to a frighteningly horrendous degree as dastardly no-count meanie Voldar. But the top bad acting dishonors clearly go to Bill McCutcheon as the annoyingly giddy'n'giggly Dropo, who's supposed to be the comic relief of the piece, but instead comes across as a profoundly obnoxious nuisance. Of course, there's also the single most pitiful and unconvincing polar bear to ever shamble its pathetic way in front of a camera. The big clunky robot Torg is markedly less than impressive as well. The sets appear to be built out of cardboard, the cinematography looks ratty and washed-out throughout, the pace plods like a sad snail doped up on anti-depressant drugs, the fumbling (non)direction stinks, and the painfully forced attempts at wacky humor leave a great deal to be desired. Moreover, you'll never be able to forget that irritatingly catchy theme song \"Hooray for Santa Claus\" no matter how hard you try. As an added plus, the adorable Pia Zadora makes her illustrious cinematic debut as an unhappy Martain kid. A deliciously dreadful doozy.</div>\n",

Christmas is pretty homely too after the tree and wrappings have been thrown into the burn pile out back. Acting? Sound track? Continuity? Plot? Character development? Photography? Choreography?

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I can still remember, as a kid back in 1964, seeing the TV commercials advertising that \"Santa Claus Conquers The Martians\" was coming to the local movie theater. I am watching it right now on Movies TV! It's on their Saturday morning popcorn movies lineup. Since it's the Saturday before Christmas, it's an appropriate time to show it. The plot of martians coming to earth to kidnap Santa Claus in order to get Martian kids to stop watching earth TV programs is a unique idea. It's kind of silly but earth kids back in 1964 would believe most anything. The special effects are OK and the makeup is good enough the time period. There are some legitimate actors in SCCTM. John Call was well cast as Santa. He had a long career both as a stage, movie and TV actor. What with the internet today, modern kids would probably not be too interested. But, it might be an enjoyable movie for really young kids who aren't into the internet and cell phones yet. And for any of us who still believe in Santa Claus.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I remember seeing this movie a long time ago, way back before they installed the cup holders on the theater seat arm rests. You know, the good old days.  All I could remember was the bright lights and colors, the green Martians, Santa was in it, and that \"song\" (S-A-N-T-A, C-L-A-U-S....)<br/><br/>The next time I saw it, I was a freshman in college and it was playing at the local pub's Bad Flick Night.<br/><br/>Time was not kind.<br/><br/>It's a kid's movie, provided the kid is mentally deficient, a hostile brat and/or has short-term attention disorder.  Either way, this one will appeal to them.<br/><br/>For the rest of us, there's the issues of Santa-kidnapping Martians in BRIGHT green makeup and helmets that resemble Yul Brynner's headgear in \"The Ten Commandments\"; other Martians that you either want to punch out (Dropo) or try and talk out of future acting opportunities (a young Pia Zadora-???); Santas that walk around saying \"Merry Christmas\", despite the fact that Christmas is not even close; pop guns that immobilize people; polar bears that have extremely long hind legs; and blah, and blah, and blah...<br/><br/>But DOES Santa Claus actually conquer the Martians of the title, like it says?  Yep, but he doesn't hit, punch, kick, bite, scratch, claw or anything. Sorry kids, green blood does not flow here.  You see, Santa puts in a Martian North Pole workshop and wins over the Martians with peace and good will towards men...and Martians too, I guess.  He even makes lazy good-for-nothing Dropo a Martian Santa.  GOOD; anything that will keep that nutcase on his own planet....<br/><br/>Two stars for SCCTM; one star for the Christmas spirit and another for the fact that it was half-price beer night when I went in that pub to see it again.<br/><br/>Maybe they should do that for \"The Horse Whisperer\"....</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">There is plenty of films that get made that turn out bad. Hollywood has given us lots of mega turds. Every Adam Sandler movie is terrible. Also most films that featured a Saturday Night Live Character are most of the time laugh free. All of them cost millions and most of them could not ring a laugh out of me. Not to mention none of them have one moment that was worth remembering. This is not the case with \"Sana Claus Conquers the Martians\". It is campy but it is fun. There is plenty of memorable moments. My favorite is when the toy manufacturing machine goes haywire. <br/><br/>In this movie the people of Mars kidnap Santa Claus so he can bring the \"Child Out\" in the children of Mars. Yes its not great cinema but it is entertaining<br/><br/>Adults if you don't like it fine but children will. It is made for children that believe in Santa.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I only watched this because for about forty years I have seen it listed among science fiction movies. Yes one reviewer said it was made for kids. That's true. Others were made for adults. However, bad is bad. Who the film was directed at is of no consequences. I would suspect short attention spans, would last about five minutes. It's just a rambling mess of mistaken identity and ridiculous situations, going nowhere. Santa is OK in his ho, ho, ho, sort of way, but he even looks bored and confused at times. He is brought to Mars to get the kids to focus on more traditional Martian values or something. They are watching too much TV, I guess. But the pitfalls are that the Martians are so uninteresting. Earthlings with shoe polish on their faces--it even rubs off at times. There is the obligatory bad guy. I guess he's on a power trip because what difference does it all make? The title is really the best part of the movie.</div>\n",

The action takes place in a world where Santa Claus (John Call) is real, and his elves are busy working overtime for the upcoming Christmas season.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, on Mars, Martian children watch our pirated TV broadcasts, and discover their own lack of a Santa. What to do? Why, kidnap the jolly old elf, of course! On the plus side, we learn much about Martian culture and customs, and their penchant for wearing toaster covers, complete with natural gas lines on their noggins. We also learn that space travel is as easy as catching the bus, transporting Martians millions of miles in minutes!<br/><br/>Does Santa stand a chance? Once abducted, can the world possibly cope with its Santa-less state?<br/><br/>No, I tells ya!<br/><br/>One need only see this movie once, in order to realize where a certain Mr. Lucas may have gotten his ideas! Featuring future super-omni-mega-star, Pia Zadora in her most convincing role as Martian girl, Girmar, SCCTM is pure mesmerizing merriment! There's even a refrigerator box robot! Highly recommended for those under 5 years of age.<br/><br/>P.S.- This movie is the perfect companion for the STAR WARS HOLIDAY SPECIAL!...</div>\n",

To me this film was part of the annual must see movies when it popped up on television during Christmas. Yes the plot is silly. The acting silly but you know what \"I still enjoy this film\" because at the end of the day it still told a story and it entertained me. <br/><br/>Now the lo frills special effects help makes this film charming. It is very sad that this film is in the public domain. Which means everybody can release this film on DVD also there is no money that can be made from a restoration which this film sadly needs. <br/><br/>If you don't know the story in a nutshell:<br/><br/>Martian ruler Kimar (Leonard Hicks) is upset that the children of Mars are lazy and under the influence of too much pop culture from Earth. They are obsessed with the planet's television programs and don't want to do much of anything. In an attempt to get the kids peppy again, Kimar orders the kidnapping of Santa Claus (John Call), hoping that the jolly old toy maker will know how to cheer the children up again. But two Earth children are also nabbed, and this complicates things for Kimar.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This unflinchingly testament to the tensions of the Cold War represents a typically enterprising choice by Talking Pictures as their Christmas treat for the kiddies. Often reviled as one of the worst films ever made: for God's lighten up, it's for kids, who absolutely lapped it up! It's all very pretty in colour and it boasts a charming song that later sold well as a single.<br/><br/>Santa himself is portrayed as a genial old cove who smokes a pipe, and his Missus makes a rare screen appearance. The Martians wear probably the silliest outfits - with headdresses that make them look like insects - since the days of 'Flash Gordon' (although 'Lost in Space was soon to surpass it) and one the daftest-looking robots you're ever likely to see.<br/><br/>The Martians all have American accents, greet each by rubbing noses and seem to consist of just one family and a handful of henchmen. The po-faced delivery by most of the cast is rather at odds with the raucous score by Milton DeLugg, and the sets belong in the shabbier episodes of 'Star Trek'.<br/><br/>It's good to see both sides of the Iron Curtain united against a common foe. There's also a little bit of what passes for topical humour in that one of Santa's reindeer is called 'Nixon' and the head of America's space programme is called 'Werner von Green' and that one of the Martians is entranced by his introduction to the slinky spring.<br/><br/>Predictably the least funny element is the comedy relief.</div>\n",

I couldn't stop watching it.<br/><br/>The plot is about what happens when Saint Nicholas himself is kidnapped by Martians and they also kidnap two Earth-Children to help them find him as there's too many of his impersonators for them to identify the real thing. The premise is daft but the execution is brilliant as you really do believe that you are seeing real-life Martians kidnapping Santa from the North Pole. Taking him to their base on Mars all chaos breaks loose but Santa doesn't actually conquer the Martians at all meaning that the title is a lie but if you can get past the misleading title you'll find this to be an incredible Christmas treat that is not to be missed, in fact you have no excuse to miss this as it's in the public domain and the whole thing is on YouTube for free.<br/><br/>The acting, directing, writing, effects and sets are all superb. This didn't win any awards which is nothing short of daylight robbery, this movie is so good that it puts the likes of \"The Shawshank Redemption\" and \"The Dark Knight\" and \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" to shame for how shoddy they are; I didn't laugh even once at any of them but every moment of this is spectacular comedy. I give this ten out of ten!</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Ti West's movie really should have been called \"E\" for elevated. It sets itself up as a smart take on the slasher films of the 70s and early 80s. As a bonus, the film within a film has the filmmakers making an 'elevated' porn flick (as a bonus, actor Owen Campbell who plays the \"Director\" even looks a bit like Director Tobe Hooper).<br/><br/>Quite consciously taking it's set up from Tobe Hooper's 1974 TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, X has a group of randy pornographers renting a farmhouse from an elderly couple in the middle of nowhere in Texas (actually New Zealand). Writer-Director West's main idea here is to set up a contrast between the XXX filmmakers and the bible thumping civilians of the area. It's not an uninteresting idea, which, of course, plays off the the puritanical cliche in the slasher films of yore where the most sexually active characters are the most likely to g et killed off. In addition to MASSACRE, West includes nods to FRIDAY THE 13TH, Hooper's EATEN ALIVE and a very specific one to HALLOWEEN. X is set about 5 years after MASSACRE so that it can include a brief exchange about how home video will change the porno industry (adult films were already available on VHS for about 3 years).<br/><br/>The movie is very well directed, with savvy use of cross-cutting between the porn film in the making and the terrors that await the group. Mia Goth (in a dual role; actually a triple if you stay after the credits) and Brittany Snow are the two pornstars to be and each dive in with relish. Kid Cudi is the cocky stud, while Martin Henderson is solid as the confidant Producer. Jenna Ortega is the \"crew\" all by her lonesome (she manages to keep her clothes on - must have a better agent). Stephen Ure is the ornery old man who rents out his guest house.<br/><br/>As good as the filmmaking is, X ends up feeling too studied. The pacing is lugubrious even if it picks up towards the very end. Once the massacre begins (if not by power tools) it still ends up being fairly typical of the films it's commenting on, regardless of how well executed and 'elevated' it thinks it is. It's also too drawn out to satisfy some gore-hounds and once the blood starts flowing, probably too gross for the internet scribes dreaming of doing extended online essays dissecting it for it's elevated intellect. There are a couple of twists, but they aren't sufficient enough to compensate for the predictability.<br/><br/>In the end, it's not as clever as West thinks it is, and despite some good Directing chops and acting, it's simply too self-conscious to be much of a fun thrill ride.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I liked it. It's a nice old-fashioned (flawlessly 70's styled) slasher horror-flick, with a fairly original premise. As in any comparable horror movie the motives for the killings are pretty farfetched, but who cares, when they are pictured so relentlessley gruesome, the gore here is definitely not for the tender-hearted. Another strong point is how the movie very gradually builds up the tension, this is a real slow burner, the apprehension of looming doom is palpable throughout the movie. This is helped by a strong direction, a very clever and inventive editing, and some great photography, see for instance the scene of one of the girls swimming in the lake, while... well, I won't give it away, but it's beautiful and hair-raisingly scary at the same time!<br/><br/>Add to all this some very funny dialogues and goings-on at the start, and you're in for a well made, old-school horror flick, maybe not life-changing but absolutely entertaining for those who can apprciate this kind of movie (like me!).</div>\n",

Some said decent acting and a good gore fest.<br/><br/>It was all of the above, though I'd say less porn, there are some nude/sex scenes but they're really not the heart of the movie. The gore is well done, the acting is very good I think, and the overall slasher aspect is reasonable, though it could have been a little more creative.<br/><br/>Saying all of that none of it is what I'll remember this movie for. What really struck me in this movie was the portrayal of age and how it affects people and their relationships, I actually felt really sad for some of the characters in this movie, and that isn't usually how I'd expect to feel watching a slasher. It really did feel like the writers, directors,. And actors were trying to remind us of something whilst also making a decent slasher. I think it's to value our youth, and our lives as much as we can. I don't want to say much more as I don't want to spoil the movie. Needless to say if you're looking for a decent movie to check out I'd recommend giving this a go. It will entertain you and also make you think a little about the problems others have.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">While I knew this film was presented as a slasher film going in, I had better expectations given it was an A24 Studios film. Despite some of the famous names in the cast, I wouldn't consider it good. Probably my least favorite from the A24 films. The film is made in the cinematography style of classic 1970s slasher films, but it holds back on the brutality with the females. I really wished A24 was above PC culture.<br/><br/>True 70s slasher/horror films were very brutal with both genders but not this one except perhaps with the old woman/zomb-et at the end.<br/><br/>I was hoping at least a slightly smarter screenplay given it is A24, but disappointingly no. Mia Goth was probably the only likable character in the film. But I feel the special effects people overdid the prosthetics with the old couple. They resemble zombie monsters far more than the elderly. They could have placed a real elderly couple in there instead. Yes, the film does have some gore and blood but its predominately a very tame film. The worst of it all is a disembowel cow hit by a truck on the highway. It's not even part of the main story and we also see the aftermath of the accident.<br/><br/>I don't feel the film deserves to be elevated because of the technical production. Authentic 1970s low budget B films were not technically sophisticated in camera work and lighting. The fancy lighting and best cinematographers of the time were reserved for mainstream big studio films and not low budget horror. With today's pre-fab software plugins templates for adobe software, copying the style wasn't an Einstein endeavor. Had this film been made by any other no name production studio, it would have been relegated into another Netflix Original category and not given accolades. The recent Netflix Texas Chainsaw original from 2022 is just as good a film as this one minus the famous actors.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">An interesting slow burn, but without enough to make it stand against the countless other slasher films, X is a fine film and another tribute to the iconic genre that made horror so popular in the first place. Granted, I do enjoy myself a slasher film from time to time- I'm quite fond of films like Nightmare on Elm Street and My Bloody Valentine, but where X faults among the others is through using a rather familiar formula without any true unique purpose. Throughout the film the characters often talk about an X factor, something that makes Mia Goth's character special and starworthy- but unlike its mentionings- this film just doesn't have that. The acting is really good, I love the underrated Mia Goth as always- as well as Brittany Snow, Martin Henderson, and even Kid Cudi did a rather impressive job. The cinematography is fantastic and perfectly fits the amitpshere and tone the film is going for. The music is enjoyable and tense, and its pacing can be a bit slow at times, but does allow for an interesting point of view. Its main problem lies solely in its script, which revolves largely around a smut film production- but takes too many elements and formulaic tendencies from other horror films like Evil Dead, Friday the 13th, The Visit and most obviously Texas Chainsaw Massacre to really stand out on its own and become its own thing. In the end, its not a bad watch, I wouldn't watch it again, but I certainly didn't mind watching it. It isn't the most memorable, but I certainly don't have any disdain for it. It just could have been more, especially given the talent involved, but ironically it settled for less.<br/><br/>My Rating: 5.8/10.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Paying homage to the slashers of yesteryear is nothing new, but Ti West's new movie X makes it feel fresh. He does this by primarily bringing attention to the sex parts of the genre and exploring what sex means. This is, after all, in part about a crew of people attempting to make a porno. But the sex angle goes beyond just cheap titillation. It is at the heart of the film, and West seems to be most interested in what the experience means, whether it's for love, a way to recapture youth, or getting the most out of life while one is still capable of experiencing the act.<br/><br/>Beyond all this, though, is a fun, classically styled slasher that is equal parts titillation and slasher mayhem. Some may find the amount of nudity and sex, and heck the subject matter itself, distasteful, but for slasher fans, this will remind you of much of the early years of the genre. A lot has been made about how this is so heavily inspired by Texas Chainsaw Massacre and it's easy to see why. The majority of the film revolves around the singular location, an old farm seemingly in the middle of nowhere, Texas, ripe for plenty of slasher fun. Ti doesn't skimp on the red stuff either. While nothing gets too outlandishly creative, we do get some brutal kills with often gory results.<br/><br/>It helps that characters are written well and likable. Despite the sleazy material they're attempting to create, they don't feel shallow or sleazy themselves. They believe in their work and the reasons for making it. While it may have been nice to get a little more depth out of them, they clearly have history and there are things hinted at that never get much development, they're at least a decent crowd of folks who are fun to be around. As for the villains, they're not quite as out there or mysterious as the trailer would lead you to believe. In fact, they're pretty grounded, but never the less creepy and tension is maintained consistently once the violence starts.<br/><br/>If you know what the film's about, you have a pretty good idea of what to expect. It does take some unusual turns, but for me that only added to just how much the film stood on it's own. It certainly feels like a fresh entry into the slasher genre, something the genre needs. Ti West continues to make a name for himself as someone to watch out for. Have fun with this sexy, bloody good time.</div>\n",

They begin filming but the old guy and his wife have other plans. Soon the young people are fighting for their lives.<br/><br/>This is a very odd film. It's a solid hour before any horror kicks in but when it does it's VERY bloody, gruesome and pretty sick. However it is well-done, the acting is good and there is plenty of female and male frontal nudity. Also I love how the opening and closing credits look like they came off an old porno flick! Worth a look but the buildup to the blood and guts is kind of slow.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">X (2022) is a recent horror from Ti West that feels like a homage to THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE complete with '70s trappings and grindhouse feel. The story is about the actors and crew of a low budget porn shoot heading to a remote cabin owned by a couple of oldsters. All goes well until nightfall, when murderous intentions arise and things soon turn into a night of terror. I hadn't liked West's CABIN FEVER 2 or HOUSE OF THE DEVIL and didn't expect to like this either, and - surprise! - I hated it.<br/><br/>It's not a slow burner (for a change) but it is void of horror content, or any interesting content at all really. For the first hour nothing happens apart from time-wasting with annoying characters, bad dialogue, and endless sex scenes that smack of padding. In the last 45 minutes it becomes a fairly gory but unconvincing slasher, with bad makeup and more cliches than you can shake a stick at. It's the film's senselessness that really got to me, like the female crew member who suddenly decides she wants to star in the shoot. Yeah, okay, that would happen.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">\"X\" is a very bloody, and satisfying horror film from A24 that is able to pack enough scary moments, while also talking it's time to develop its characters.<br/><br/>The good in this movie right off the bat is the performances. Everyone in the movie is great. The standouts here are Mia Goth and Jenna Ortega. These two were great. The movie also has a really strong message about sex and what it really means for these people. It's a very strong message and it works. The gore here is also great. It's a very bloody movie and the final 40 minutes are amazing. It's also a very good looking movie. It's very well shot and there's a lot of creepiness to it. And finally I actually felt that the villains in this movie were actually very well portrayed. They were given a somewhat tragic issue, and it really added a lot to them.<br/><br/>Now I do have a few negatives. The first being that I do wish there was a little more crazy moments. I wish the movie had just a little more bloody moments. I also felt that the first act, while good, was a little too slow paced. I wish it do move a lot faster. And finally there are some things aren't fully explained towards the end.<br/><br/>Overall \"X\" is a very bloody good time with great acting, great direction, and some truly bloody moments.</div>\n",

Something I only heard from others that this is his \"comeback\" piece. Again not how I view it, but nevermind that, enjoy this horror movie that also has a sexual tone to it ... and quite a lot of innuendo.<br/><br/>The sex is not just there to titilate of course (although I was more than surprised to see Brittany Snow show what she is blessed with), no it serves the story and especially one of the many themes we have here. There is a discussion about being young, living life to the fullest or at least to an extent that makes one happy. Before you get old and have too many regrets. Young vs old is something you could say. But the less you know going in, the better you will be able to receive.<br/><br/>The acting is good and not just from the clearly younger people in old age makeup (look at in the credits who is playing the woman if you have not realized it while you were watching). Effects are top notch, though not for the faint hearted ... you cannot be too squeamish.<br/><br/>Go in this ride, that while a serious slasher, is not with a touch (or more) of dark humor. And if you read some innuendo in what I just wrote ... well you may not be entirely wrong about coming ... to that conclusion.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I was about to go see Pearl then read that it's based on X in the synopsis so I thought I should view this first. And the fact that a second movie was released so soon after it's first gave me hope. It's not as good as I expected but I don't think it could have been that much better. My concept of horror is a movie that's supposed to scare you and this really doesn't; it's becoming more common for movies to throw in a couple gory scenes and death then labeling it horror. Can't call it a thriller either 'cause it didn't have me at the edge of my seat. The premise is pretty original I'll give it that but it's just not scary. Should be executed better. It's slow paced so it feels like it's building up to something and when it comes it's all over pretty quickly and I never really felt any tension in the life or death scenes. I didn't care for any of the characters either. More effort was put into the adult movie being made than put into actually frightening you.<br/><br/>The directors artistic abilities are there, trying to have the same feel as old slasher movies from the 70's. It's pretty forgettable and horror movies shouldn't be, they should make you wanna sleep with the light on. If anything the only reason I'll have trouble sleeping at night is getting the image of two grotesquely old people have sex. When the credits rolled I was trying to recall what made me think this was going to be good.</div>\n",

The fights,music, dialogues, story and screenplay are awesome. The way Aparichit punishes the wrong doers is simply marvellous! Aparichit(Anniyan) is like a superhero that has come to save us. The conversion of Tamil titles in Hindi throughout the entire movie needs to be appreciated. Shankar has really proved how a story can make superhero.<br/><br/>On the whole,Aparichit(Anniyan) is a complete family entertainer that will be appreciated by all. Go,watch it,for sure you will be entertained!</div>\n",

Direction qualifies for a new degree after good better and best. Comedy has good timing and morals delivered are clear. I have been humming the songs specially - Iyengar Vittu Adege with out really knowing what the lyrics means. Actions were well shown and well place in the movie. The scenes were so well placed.

But it's much more than that. It's much more complex than a comedy. The other personality's from Ambi are very interesting. Anniyan and Remo. Anniyan is his dark side and Remo his romantic side.

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Unlike my friends, I was awaiting Aparichit (Hindi Version) eagerly as it was a Shankar film and I like his movie a lot. To start off with, Aparichit is a good film, but at the same time it suffers from a lot of plot holes. The writer should have gone through his script before starting the shoot. I mean according to the movie, Ambi (Vikkram) is a character who suffers from multiple personality disorders but if that's the case, can Mr. Shankar explain how in the blue hell does he get all his powers from? He flies, He fights like Neo, and survives after being frozen! Its way too unrealistic. The script would have been justified if Shankar showed the concept of something supernatural out here.<br/><br/>Sada's acting is natural and Vikkram's performance, although good, has been overrated. His portrayal of Ambi and Aparichit are good but his Remo is absolutely pathetic. The movies has some really funny moments. the south Indian flavor of the film starts getting onto your nerves too much at times. The scene where Ambi's sister dies was pathetic. Music is a let down with only \"Gora Gora Aankh\" standing out and Remo should have been of shorter length. The other songs are terrible.<br/><br/>Oh did I tell you Remo can remove and fix back house roofs in less than 2-3 seconds? The plot was really good but the movie got screwed because of the writer.<br/><br/>Shankar got too carried away and made an unrealistic movie. The website and e-mail part was another trauma.<br/><br/>The action, although highly inspired by The Matrix Reloaded, is still original. Aparichit's way of punishing the wrong doers is a plus point for the movie and so is the ending. Even though the movie isn't a masterpiece, its still different from the usual flicks that we get and I'd advice that you go and watch this film. If I ever become a director in life, i'd love to remake this movie with a more realistic out look.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">To begin with Shankar's movie can be a instant mega impressive or not but might still be worth watching with the time, later as time evolves, the movie would become unwatchable. With some many good reviews for this, I decided to watch the first day first show with an idea if the movie was not so good either, I could always go for new skillful actor Vikram, I wasn't disappointed with the movie but saw little similarities with Shankar's previous movies Indian, Mudhalvan. The story is no different, he tries to convey his dream of having India a super better place to live. Without giving out too much about movie, it is real hard to review this movie but to say worth watching. The story begins with a central character Ramanujam aka Ambi aka Rules Ramanujam owing to his ability to do everything by rules and regulations, a real hard to see honest lawyer which is ironic due to the fact that all lawyers everywhere are considered \"scum bags\". Ramanujam is honest but likes a girl from his childhood but is too scared to say it out and has been locking his feelings, suppression causes \"Remo\" to come out and romance for few out of sequence songs. O boy did that song remind me of \"Azhagana Rakshisi from Mudhalvan\". Well while this goes on, Anniyan comes out to prevent the wrong doings happening in the country. Who is Anniyan, Remo, Ramanujam, watching the movie will only tell. Please have a open mind to watch the movie, don't go by anyone's opinion as you will never know? Enjoy Aniyan while cherishing acting of Vikram and Prakash Raj. Comedy by Vivek as usual rocks. Worth watching at least once?</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Shankar and Vikram have done a fantastic job. Director Shankar is turning into a professional high-quality perfectionist. Actor Vikram, charged with a National award for Best Actor (2004) is on a roll. His performance is classy and comparable to many great actors of Tamil cinema.<br/><br/>Anniyan is definitely worth watching at least once. Forget about the critics who list past movies from which various aspects of Anniyan (like concept, theme, stunts, music) was inspired (or copied). It is easier to make the original than to make a copy as the original serves as a hard benchmark. It is hard to replicate something while maintaining audience interest. Shankar does this job to a more-than-satisfying extent.<br/><br/>Besides, when great directors like Steven Spielberg copy past movies (War of the worlds) with the confidence of providing the viewers something worthwhile to watch, I don't see anything wrong in Shankar's Anniyan. Yet, Anniyan is NOT a complete copy and it is definitely MORE than the sum of its parts.<br/><br/>Anniyan has stunts that were never before seen in any Tamil movie. Shankar has provided the opportunity to the (uneducated mass of) Tamil audience of watching world-class stunts in a movie that they can understand (as against most Hollywood flicks that have the action but make no sense to them). So what, if it has been copied? Matrix Reloaded being largely mystifying and unexplained, even to most native-English speakers, could not justify to the (masses of the) Tamil audience as to why all the action exists!!??. But that is not the case with Anniyan.<br/><br/>To sum it all up, Anniyan is what a movie should really be. A classy entertainer. Good songs, great cinematography, wonderful (although sometimes unbelievable) stunts, great acting performance, nice comedy and classic direction. Watch the movie without prejudice and be entertained.</div>\n",

It is watchable enough for VIKRAM'S performance alone, but Vivek's hilarious comedy and one-liners, Harris Jeyraj's great songs and amazing sets and location make this film a must-see for all Tamil cinema lovers. The highlight of the film is the last 23 minutes, these minutes alone should entice even a cinema goer not a fan of VIKRAM or Shankar to go and see the film at least once more.

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Shankar is my favorite film maker. His movies have speed, tightly woven script. His movies are frame by frame perfect. He hits at corrupt system hard with varying backdrops. <br/><br/>This one too hits at system. But the treatment is diff from all his other movies. Acting is extremely good. Sharp camera work which is the trademark of Shankar is terrific in this movie too. <br/><br/>I am not in the habit of disclosing story in my reviews. So I would say that story is very different and is not quite common. Movie has some very light resemblance to his own old creation Hindustani(Kamal Hasan) where he uses some old Indian traditional art to tackle corruption. In this movie too he uses some thing which is part of very old Indian culture. <br/><br/>Movie has suspense which keeps audience at the edge of their seats.<br/><br/>Thank you Shankar for these movies. May god give you unlimited energy and age and you keep making terrific movies. Eagerly waiting for Amitabh, Rajnikanth and Kamal Hasan in single movie together.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Ahhhh..... these were the times. I remember the day when my friend and I went for the matinée to watch this movie on the first week of its release in Kerala. I was 14 back then and had no reputed history of watching Tamil movies or any knowledge about the director's previous works what so ever, other than boys (I knew Vikram from some of his Malayalam movies though). And there it was one of a rare gift you can give to a teenage boy who was obsessed with pop culture, action and thrillers. I was blown away at the end of the movie; I got the thrill ride which I only used to expect from a Hollywood movie. The movie has it all....it's a psychological thriller; it's got action, comedy, romance, and the usual Tamil masala ingredients that all other Indian movies are trying so desperately to capture, nowadays. This was the movie that got me interested to Tamil movies.<br/><br/>Before watching this movie I had no idea about personality disorders, so it was more like me asking myself.. (Before the interval) 'What's going on?? Are there 3 people?? Does he have super powers?? Is he the villain?? Maybe they're twins or triplets'. Vikram did a well commendable work in this movie. The character shifts, the way the body language and the speech patterns changes were all a great performance. The way Shankar portrayed Anniyan as the Hindu version of a mass murdering, ass kicking, Grim reaper was a spectacle; the way he fights others with tremendous strength and speed made me think... what the hell are they dealing with over there?? While the other two personalities showed more vulnerability to violence. I would say that this movie did something new by not having a villain and showing Anniyan with all the characteristics of a scary villain (first thing i noticed was the hairstyle from 'the ring') and making him as mass murdering social hero which was something new at that time.....for me at least. I would say Anniyan is one of a kind and a worth a must watch.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Exotic visuals, breathtaking action scenes and well choreographed songs are the hallmark of Shankar and he does not disappoint you in Anniyan. Combined with Vikram's brilliant portrayal of various roles Anniyan in one word is 'Amazing'. Though Anniyan resembles Shankar's earlier films Indian and Muthalvan, it's the narration which makes all the difference.<br/><br/>Ramanujam alias Ambi (Vikram) is called as Rules Ramanujam as he goes by the rule book. A lawyer by profession, he reacts to people who break the rules like disobeying traffic rules, not helping people in distress, eve-teasing in transport buses, spitting on roads, not providing standard meals in trains and so on. His good intentions and proper approach do not take him anywhere. He is a stickler for rules and that does not always work.<br/><br/>His father Parthasarathy (Nedumudi Venu) keeps advising him that single handedly he cannot change the world. He gets shattered when he realizes that his childhood friend and now a medical student Nandhini (Sada) refuses his love.<br/><br/>He comes across a website anniyan.com which follows the Garudapuranam, the Hindu folklore which is similar to the Christian judgment which reveals that those who commit misdeeds will be punished in hell according to the degree of their deeds. And Ambi takes the avatar of Anniyan. He kick starts a process through which he starts punishing the wicked people on earth. In the meantime, there is another character Remo, a ravishing supermodel who tries to cajole Nandhini, and she falls head over heels in love with him. Remo is none other than Ambi.<br/><br/>One day on seeing Nandhini cheating the income tax people Ambi transforms to Anniyan and chases her to kill her. Nandhini realizing something wrong with Ambi take him to a psychiatrist, who discovers that Ambi suffers from Multiple Personality Disorder (MPD). In a split second, Ambi transforms into Anniyan and then to Remo much to the surprise of the doctors and Nandhini. In a flashback, it is revealed why Ambi suffers from MPD. Amidst all this drama, an untiring policeman Prabhakar (Prakash Raj) gets down to track all the killings and the mystery behind them. Whether the police manage to nail Ambi forms the thrilling climax.<br/><br/>Vikram has three dimensions to his role. He easily slips into all three characters. Anniyan is definitely a feather in the cap of Vikram. Sada is passable. She excels only in the glamorous songs but acting wise has a long way to go. Nedumudi Venu as the hero's father does a good job. Vivek's comedy does raise a few laughs. Prakashraj is the scene stealer and matches up to Vikram.<br/><br/>Manikandan and Ravi Verman combo gives a visual treat. The Nokia song is the best of the lot. Harris Jayaraj music with the visuals gives a stunning effect. Shankar who dealt with major issues like corruption in education and public life and exposed the lack of political will to govern, has in Anniyan stressed on the need for civic discipline and accountability by the public. 'If three crore citizens steal five paisa each then is it not a big crime?' is the question posed by the director. He drives home the point that many things that we come across in day to day life and just ignore can be set right if one stands up against them. From the yellow line violation to the manufacturer who makes substandard brake cables, all are equally responsible for the country going to the dogs. The split personality funda attracts more than a few people because of its uniqueness and queer nature.<br/><br/>Peter Heyen's action sequences are well choreographed and the fight in which Anniyan takes on the kungfu exponents is a treat to watch.<br/><br/>Anniyan is an out and out family entertainer.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I can't believe I'm writing a review for a movie this bad. I know better than to expect good movies from the Tamil film industry these days, but this one came as a shocker nevertheless. I don't remember the last half-decent movie I saw that came from home - probably Autograph. It's a shame: the same industry that produced Kadhalikka Neramillai, Nayagan, Mouna Ragam...but I digress. <br/><br/>What hurts me most is hypocrisy in such *message* movies. I will eat the humble pie if anything changes in India after Shankar makes a million of these movies a million times over. Anniyan was just a fool-proof formula masquerading as a film that had a social message. Try telling someone else that Shankar cares about anything except for the commercial success of his movies. <br/><br/>And for heaven's sake, why can't we be original? There's one very interesting forum topic here that's discussing the number of English movies this was a rip-off from. I'm sure the quiz-masters are getting their notepads ready for a mega question: play a couple of scenes and then ask the contestants to name all the original movies that 'inspired' those scenes. <br/><br/>Don't even let me get started on the song lyrics... Now that I've berated it enough, let me explain why I gave it the three stars that I did. Song visualisations. Vivek's comedy (a *big* saving grace - 2 stars). <br/><br/>I'm not going to ask you not to watch it. You are either going to think I'm stupid, or that I watch only Bergman, Fellini, Renoir and Eisenstein to be saying such ridiculous things. So, go ahead by all means. And God bless our country if such movies are going to change it.</div>\n",

Bit slow in the first half and some times make the viewer think a bit. Prakashraj's mufti useless and Vivek's comedy good and enjoyable Shankar's direction good. song scenes are good but not in line with the story, seems to be created for masala lovers. Should have given more stress to the art part of the movie. Not suitable for any international nominations as some of the scenes are not very logical. good story line much much better than chandramukhi all in all a very good movie</div>\n",

It has everything emotions , science , actions , comedy , romance. Amazing Comedy by Vivek sir and the BGM, camera angles and screenplay is impressive. I don't liked 1 thing that is the action , some old type but it is a good movie.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">One of the biggest flaws in this movie concerns the same thing that Shankar actually got right during Boys. In Boys, 99% of the characters were new entrants and unknowns and were thus were very realistic and highly effective in their roles. However, in Anniyan, every villain, every common bad guy and every misc character were played by big leaguers who would have been familiar for the zillionth time. A coupla comedians play bad guys and are extremely ineffective in that role and difficult to take seriously. Thus the elements of shock normally present in a Shankar flick do not exist in Anniyan. The second biggest flaw is the overuse of really bad CGI, cheap gimmickry and too many references to the internet. Third, too many movies have been copied and the remakes of the scenes look utterly stupid. This movie has obviously been formulated and engineered to rake in money at the box office without actually offering anything amazing or worthy.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">One of the best Indian thrillers yet, Aparichitudu succeeds not only in grabbing the audience's attention, but in keeping us thinking as well. It's about a judicious man, Ramu who is fussy about everyone following rules and happens to be the only person noticing the injustice in his corrupt society. No doubt, he is very well educated , disciplined and religious. However, his qualifications and marriage applications (classic) are not enough to pursue Nandini, his love interest who I find terribly non-empathetic. That's right, a man who really cares for her does not seem to impress her. Due to frustration and Nandini's spiteful words, he almost drowns himself. But that's not the end. Another personality, the flamboyant and hip Remo springs into picture and we see Ramu undergo a complete makeover. He blows Nandu's breathe away with his \"hot\" highlights and \"smooth moves\". Thankfully, he is not the most catchy and unique thing in this movie. These were the times when I literally wanted to leave the theatre, not that the movie was getting nowhere, but Ramu was being severely tortured by a gang of hunks, and Nandini doesn't take his advice, things are going, well, horribly",
      "Up to the rescue is the amazing but scary personality of Aparichitudu with his hair creepily in front of his face, punishing all those people who did wrong to him and who broke the rules of society, following the way- too dangerous contents of the Garudapuranam and leaving hints behind. Although his ways are ethically questionable, Aparichitudu's personality is the heart of this film. But will Ramu's multi-personality disorder crises be discovered? If so, how does he get cured? How and where did Aparichitudu come from? Under what circumstances will he leave the citizens alone? What happens when Nandini finds out? All these questions are answered in this twisting movie.</div>\n",

A great film which involves multi personality disorder, and a message to the common Indian public which rings true.<br/><br/>the film has some obvious logic flaws such a REMO's hair being streaked and the others don't reflect that change! <br/><br/>also many people complained that the heroine is too thin! I for one am unable to understand the southindians obsession with the Fat heroine's! Sada was good in the role, not just cardboard cut out, also her figure is great.<br/><br/>We then come to Viikram's acting, he has done a Excellent job at it, portraying 3 different people is a challenge for any actor, and the change can be seen in the person's face.<br/><br/>The message Aprichit (anniyan) passed on to the public about people not caring for the rules is a profound message and really made me think, that he does have a point! <br/><br/>all in all the a enjoyable film ,with some good scenes, some flaws and important message to deliver.</div>\n",

The film is illogical, inconsistent, over the top. At no point in the 3 hours does the narrative ever grip you. Oh for crying out loud, hire an experienced screenwriter next time.

Shankar was pathetic in trying to churn out a mediocre entertainer to fill his pocket rather than go with the type of new and graphically controvertial ideas that come into mind which make his movies so exclusive. Heres where Anniyan fails,<br/><br/>Plot - Essentially a repeat of Indian and Mudhalvan and not as good as either by far. This time around, the people get blamed for their behavior in society. When you think about it, it did a little bit of potential and the movie could have been a bit more violent and used some better ideas devoid of clichés. All the familiar stories show up.<br/><br/>Acting - The worst ever. The bad deeds done by society are all unconvincing, look intentional for the camera and are done by too many familiar actors who you simply can't picture playing such roles. Vikram's acting is highly overrated and utterly stupid as that Remo character. In all of Shankar's movies, the acting was super realistic to the extent that it shocked you. Not here. It was lame. Prakash Raj just plays himself and is an unconvincing police officer.<br/><br/>Action - Horrid, comical style fight scenes with a 3rd rate repeat of matrix and kill bill fight scenes with 1/50th the budget. The stunt and camera guys really ripped Shankar off.<br/><br/>Comedy - Very good. Vivek keeps the movie going. Some other characters also deliver good comedy. <br/><br/>Songs - No AR Rehman. Nuff said.<br/><br/>Special effects - Why do stupid 3D Graphics and CGI done by the worst ever teams keep showing up? They have no point whatsoever. They are embarrassing. Did Shankar really think that the audience was dumb enough to buy that Anniyan 3D animated an entire world using only Macromedia Flash?<br/><br/>If you look at Boys, you can see that Shankar really wanted to make his movies as graphic and realistic as possible. This movie is neither. It tries to be and look violent but poor screenplay and poor cinematography ruin it. Anniyan is more of kids flick than a shocking Shankar thriller.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">In The Wages of Fear, four men in a remote South American town have the enviable task of transporting a metric buttload (technical term) of nitroglycerin across mountainous roads in poor condition. It's a taut, superbly suspenseful thriller, guided with a steady hand by director Henri-Georges Clouzot, who would go on to direct the classic Diabolique in 1955.<br/><br/>Yves Montand, in a rare dramatic role, plays Mario, the ostensible protagonist of our tale. He's been stuck in this backwater for some time, but it costs a lot of money to get out – plane fares are through the roof, and there's no train, and there's no neighboring village. In short, you're stuck there until you can buy a ticket – and pay for a passport, of course.<br/><br/>Mario spends his days looking for work, wooing tavern worker Linda, and despairing about the lack of work. There's an American oil company in town, but they're no longer hiring. His monotonous lifestyle is interrupted by the arrival of fellow expat Jo (Charles Vanel), a tough-looking older man who quickly wins Mario's favor at the expense of the rest of the men in town.<br/><br/>The oil company, in fact, has its own problem – one of their large derricks has exploded, causing a huge oil fire. Company man Bill O'Brien decides to send two trucks loaded with nitro from the town up the mountain to the derrick. (The eventual idea is to set off charges, which will somehow contain or extinguish the fire.) O'Brien has no trouble scaring up volunteers for the task, since the men of the town are largely unemployed. Four men will be selected to take the two trucks. Only one truck is needed; the second is truly just in case there's an accident with the first one. The men will receive $2000 when the work is finished, more than enough to secure passage out of the backwater.<br/><br/>Mario and Jo are chosen, as are Mario's roommate Luigi (Folco Lulli) and German expat Bimba (Peter van Eyck). The two trucks depart early in the morning, full of gas and of nitro. Danger awaits.<br/><br/>Theirs is not an easy task. The road is full of ruts. In one place, the wooden deck that trucks use to make a sharp turn up the mountain has been damaged from disuse. It's hot and muggy. And one has to be very, very careful, as even the smallest bump might set the whole shebang off. There's also tension among the four drivers – Luigi is unhappy that Mario is spending more time with Jo than with him, Mario is unhappy with what he perceives as Jo's cowardice. Bimba seems to get along with everyone, though.<br/><br/>The whole time I was watching this movie, I was certain not all four were going to make it. I will not spoil what is now a sixty-three-year-old movie, but I was still genuinely surprised by the ending. This ain't no fairy tale or sitcom. This is a movie about desperation, redemption, sacrifice, and comeuppance. It's not necessarily about justice.<br/><br/>The Wages of Fear is a singularly terrific movie from start to finish, exquisitely shot and expertly written. Its money maker is its tension, something present here in spades. The writing is impeccable; even personality changes make perfect sense within the film's context. There are intricacies within a straightforward plot. This is a must see for lovers of thrillers.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">\"The Wages of Fear\" was awarded by unanimous verdict the Grand Prix at 1953 Cannes Film Festival where it won over 27 films, some of which were made by Jacques Tati, Alfred Hitchcock, and Luis Buñuel. Cluozot's own screenplay (based a novel by George Arnaud) focuses on four down-and-out European adventurers (Yves Montand, Folco Lulli, Peter Van Eyck, Charles Vanel) who stuck nearly penniless in a festering town in an unnamed South American country. An oil company need a load of highly dangerous and explosive nitroglycerin to be delivered to a remote well fire 300 miles away burning out of control. The route is through jungles and over crude and treacherous mountains and those men are desperate enough to take the chance. None of these men is heroic or generous, they are in for the money. The four were chosen by the managers of oil company because \"if something happens to them, no one would care, they have nobody to worry about them\". Henri-Georges Clouzot's view on humanity is not particularly optimistic but he finds a way to make a viewer care about disenchanted but desperate characters. Thanks to Clouzot's ability to create not only a gripping action film but a powerful study of failure, the four men will stay for long time in our memory.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">In a remote South American town, four men are hired by an American oil company to transport two truckloads of nitroglycerin to an oil field, to put out a fire. It's a very hazardous task - the nitroglycerin can explode for the slightest reason, the road is treacherous and the journey is a long one. However, the money is very good and their current situation in the town is rather dire - they will do anything to improve their situation. <br/><br/>Great thriller-drama by French director HG Clouzot. Starts slowly and even once the hazardous journey is in progress, it doesn't seem that brilliant. However, Clouzot builds the tension and from a point it is absolutely nail-biting stuff. The scene with the boulder has to be one of the most tense movie scenes I've watched in my life. <br/><br/>A good character-drama too - the way the characters develop and the relationships between the four change adds a new dimension to the drama and makes for very engaging viewing.<br/><br/>Not perfect though. Some events and plot devices don't make much sense, though aren't crucial to the movie. The ending felt quite silly and contrived. A similar result but with a more plausible, less predictable, less stupid way of getting there would have seen the movie get a perfect score.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Clouzot rarely gets the attention he deserves. He made not one, but two of the greatest thrillers of all time, 'Les Diaboliques' and 'The Wages Of Fear', both perfect examples of how to make genuinely suspenseful movies that build up an amazing amount of tension.  Most so-called thrillers made in Hollywood these days are thrillers in name only and could learn a lesson or two from these movie classics. 'The Wages Of Fear' could even be described as an action movie, but it is a CHARACTER DRIVEN action movie, and that's what makes it so special. Modern audiences with MTV attention spans might find the plot a little slow, but I think the first half of the movie, which deals with the motley collection of exiles in a poor Latin American town, is not only fascinating in itself, but really makes a massive impact on the second half. By taking his time introducing the characters and exploring their relationships and possible motivations, Clouzet adds depth and meaning to the rest of the exciting story, something very rarely achieved in this type of movie since. The cast, every single one of them, are flawless. The four leads, Mario, the fairly decent guy played by yves Montand, his new best friend the shifty M. Jo (Charles Vanel), his old pal the kind hearted Luigi (Folco Lulli), and the enigmatic Bimba (Peter van Eyck), are all brilliant. Great performances, taut and imaginative direction, crisp and impressive cinematography, and a handful of the most riveting sequences ever committed to film make 'Wages Of Fear' a truly unforgettable experience. Suspense movies don't come much better than this! Simply a masterpiece.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">As a kid watching TV shows and movies in The Fifties, I can't tell you how many I ran across that had nitroglycerine as part of the plot. There were at least a couple of Westerns along with straight dramas, but it didn't seem to matter the genre. A souped up hot rod carrying four quarts of nitro that just happened to be hanging around was used by the main character to destroy \"The Giant Gila Monster\" in a campy 1959 monster flick.<br/><br/>Whatever the fascination with nitroglycerine, and it had to be it's unpredictability, the idea of carrying around a ton of it was the premise of this film, \"The Wages of Fear\". Actually, it was two trucks carrying a ton of nitro between them, I guess to heighten the drama and provide twice as much in the way of nerve shattering tension. The thing is, unlike a host of reviewers who hold the picture in the highest regard, I really didn't get a whole lot out of the movie.<br/><br/>For starters, the first forty five minutes or so was used to introduce characters and situations that eventually had nothing to do with the outcome of the story. Yves Montand portrayed his character Mario well enough, but the guy was just a reprobate for the most part. He consistently berated the lovely saloon gal Linda (Vera Clouzot), and actually threw her in the dirt when he drove off on the mission to deliver the goods. Same thing with his partner Jo (Charles Vanel), who started the picture as one of film's ruggedest macho men, and turned into a cream puff when the going got tough. I just didn't understand how characters would just suddenly switch their basic personas as the story progressed.<br/><br/>Then there's the adventure on the road. Maybe I missed it, but what was the rationale for that wooden bridge turnabout that both drivers had trouble with? Was it that the size of the trucks wouldn't allow for a smooth ninety degree turn? Even so, after the first mishap with the truck driven by Bimba (Peter van Eyck), why would Mario feel compelled to back his truck right to the very edge of the unstable platform? It didn't make sense to me.<br/><br/>And then, showing his contempt for Jo, Mario runs him over in that manic oil pit scene. I have to admit, that was the stunner for this viewer. That scene had both actors earning their paycheck, and it rivals the clay pit scene in \"The Defiant Ones\" with Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis for sheer insanity, in another Fifties action flick. Both are just hellacious, you be the judge.<br/><br/>Except for that scene, most of the rest of the story didn't hold the same amount of interest for me. When the truck with Bimba and Luigi (Folco Lulli) blew up, I thought that it would have been better served if there was a close-up of the two men in the truck hitting a rut and offering a grimace just before fading to black and then showing the explosion. That would have better sealed their fate; I had to wonder why no one thought of it.<br/><br/>With all that, I don't mean to imply this was a terrible picture. It's watchable enough, but just doesn't seem to measure up to the accolades it's given as an IMDb Top 250 film. But that's the case for a lot of others as well, so in this case, maybe it's just me. On another day I might have seen it in an entirely different light.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This is an extraordinary movie. From the opening scene showing the squalor of a Latin American town with filth and vultures in the street and naked children begging for food amid the oppressive, fly-stirred heat, to the finale on a winding mountain road, it is just plain fascinating. True, some of the action does not bear close scrutiny. One does not siphon nitroclycerine nor does one avoid potholes or bumps in the road by driving at forty miles per hour. No matter. Let's allow a little license. And the title doesn't entirely make sense because the wages of sin are death, but the wages of those who followed their fear and did not seek to drive a nitroclycerine truck over 300 miles of bad road are life. Again, no matter.<br/><br/>This is such an original movie, every scene like little or nothing you've ever seen before (and for sure will never see again), that the little inconsistencies and some stretching of what is possible are not important. This is man against nature, man against himself reduced to a simple task. It is life in the raw. One mistake and you are dead.<br/><br/>Yves Montand has the lead as Mario, a Frenchman stranded in this god-forsaken town with only one way out: get enough money to pay for airfare. Charles Vanel is the older, tin-horn dandy who ends up with a case of the shakes. Peter Van Eyck is the man with the nerves of steel who finds this little adventure a piece of cake after forced labor in the salt mines for the Nazis. And Folco Lulli is Luigi, the happy, singing baker who hopes to return to Italy with the two thousand dollars they are paying him to drive the nitro-loaded truck.<br/><br/>This is a film depicting the primitive nature of a macho mentality. There's a lot of posturing. Every event is a potential test of manhood. Status and privilege are flouted. The weak and the poor do not inherit the earth.<br/><br/>Henri-Georges Clouzet directs and somehow manages to come up with a work of genius. One wonders how. The story, on the face of it, would seem to belong in the slush pile of a ten-cent pulp fiction mag from the 1930's. The acting is good, very good in places, but not great. The cinematography is straightforward, but nonetheless very effective. It is lean and focused always, showing us what needs to be seen without drawing attention to itself: the invisible style, which is the best. Clouzet's direction is characterized by a vivid depiction of things that we can feel: the mud and filth in the streets, the desperation and the boredom, the cruelty and meanness of men, the oil on their bodies, the singular fact of a ton of nitro in the back seat so that every move is a neuron-exposing adventure. I think that the visceral experience from beginning to end and the fine pacing are the essence of what makes this a great film.<br/><br/>Clouzet's wife, Vera Clouzet, plays Linda who first appears scrubbing the floor in an open-air bistro. She is rather extraordinary herself, finely made up and creamy white like a star of the silent film era. She grovels a lot, especially for Mario. She provides the counter-point, the contrast for the testosterone action of the movie.<br/><br/>No student of film should miss this. It would be like missing Citizen Kane or Dr. Strangelove or especially The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, which it vaguely and strangely resembles. \"La salaire de la peur\" is, regardless of its flaws, one of the best ever made.<br/><br/>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The first quarter of this movie was not particularly exciting but did set the stage for the rest of the movie. So, if you initially feel bored--STICK WITH IT!!! The plot is so incredibly simple that it seems like it must be a pretty boring picture: an oil company in South America needs to transport shipments of nitroglycerin 300 miles to an oil fire ASAP. However, due to the rotten condition of the roads and equipment, the trip seems like certain death, so they get some hungry out of work guys to do this. It doesn't sound very interesting, I'm sure, but it is. The writing, editing, pacing, acting and direction are PERFECT during this LONG trip. So many times, I found myself tensing up or moving in my seat as each near-death event occurred. The only negative? Well, the ending might be a bit of a letdown for some (though, in hindsight, I liked it despite being a bit of an anticlimax).</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">In the opening scene of Wages of Fear (1953), director Georges Henri-Clouzot provides  an inkling of the kind of claustrophobic ride we are in for. In a steamy, impoverished Latin American town called Las Piedras, insects grope clumsily in the dust, struggling to escape the strings that children have tied to them. People from all over the world congregate in the streets and bars and the air is thick with choking dust. Clouzot makes clear the desperation of the residents, \"It's like prison,\" explains one of them. \"Easy to get in, but escape is impossible.\" The Southern Oil Company (SOC - same initials as Standard Oil) runs the town and enjoys its profits while the villagers are compelled to work odd jobs just to stay alive. After a fire breaks out at one of the oil fields killing many workers, the anti-union American boss seeks experienced drivers from among the townspeople to put out the fire. It is here that the anti-American flavor runs thick and where much of this part of the film was originally excised for American audiences (but has since been restored). <br/><br/>Four men, desperate to escape their trap, agree to drive a truck loaded with nitroglycerine 300 miles over treacherous mountain roads in the hot sun for the sum of $2000 each. Transporting the nitroglycerine for them is a way out of hopelessness -- either through a big paycheck or through sudden death, with the latter appearing the more probable. Though sadly past the point in time when we can still be shocked over gangster capitalism and men selling out for money, the story is nonetheless compelling. The four who are chosen to go on this fool's errand include Mario, a young Corsican played by Yves Montand in a role that brought him widespread attention. He is carrying on an affair with a local servant girl, Linda (Vera Clouzot) who is in love with him. His treatment of her, however, is atrocious and reflects the attitude of the male-dominated society they live in. Also picked to drive one of the trucks is Jo, an aging Parisian small-time crook (Charles Vanel), Luigi (Folco Lulli), an Italian with less than a year to live, and an ex-nazi pilot (Peter van Eyck). This unlikely group will play a cat-and-mouse game with death for the remainder of the film.<br/><br/>Clouzot depicts several incidents that bring the tension to the boiling point. In the first one, the trucks must travel at least 40 mph over a pot-holed stretch of road to prevent the vibrations from setting off the nitroglycerine. The second involves a sharp, narrow turn that requires the trucks to back up onto an unstable, rotten wooden platform causing it to buckle. Almost immediately afterwards, the trucks are stopped by a huge boulder in the middle of the road and must siphon off some of the nitroglycerine to blow it up. Finally, Mario must deftly maneuver the truck over a depression of spilled oil with the wheels stuck in reverse. As the long treacherous journey unfolds, roles are reversed between Mario and Jo as Mario becomes the strong dominant one and Jo, in Charles Vanel's brilliant performance, becomes shaken, fearful, and docile. Their relationship becomes the highlight of the film as the two become mutually dependent on each other for survival and comfort. <br/><br/>I found Wages of Fear to be an involving experience that kept me riveted throughout, though I did sense that there would not be a two and a half-hour film unless somebody survived. Although the unexpected plot twists were gripping, the best part of the film for me was the revelation of each character when faced with fear. It reminded me of the \"Treasure of the Sierra Madre\", a film that also showed men discovering the truth about themselves and others while pursuing their dream of wealth. Wages of Fear lived up to its accolades, but for me the discordant ending clashed both with the tone of the film and with my experience of the universe not as arbitrary or capricious but as filled with meaning and purpose.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The setting is a dead end South American village in the middle of nowhere. Its only distinguishing feature being an American oilfield some distance away from the village. But then an accident causes a fire to spread into the oil and the only way to stop it is to literally blow it out. With nitroglycerin. The only problem being that they don't have the safety equipment needed to transport the nitro from the village. But \"luckily\" such villages have no shortage of men at the end of their ropes, willing to do anything for a final paycheck.<br/><br/>And that's essentially The Wages of Fear in a nutshell. It's about human desperation and about ever-mounting stakes as the tension keeps rising and rising. Every little tremor or stone on the road could send all four men into the sky in a fiery explosion of primordial forces. And even though you're safely hunkered on your coach, behind the reality line of a TV screen, you can't help but sweat in anguish alongside these men. The film is that well shot.<br/><br/>That being said, it takes its sweet time getting there. The first portion of the film is spent getting to know the village and these four wretched souls. And while they are interesting personalities, played by talented actors, it still drags quite a bit. And that's partly because at that point you don't have much of an idea where the film is going. Most of the loose threads get tied up towards the end, but a good half of the film is a jumbled mess.<br/><br/>But that other part where they're actually transporting the explosives is so good that it more than makes up for the weaker first half. Recommended for all fans of intense.</div>\n",

      "Set up in the boondocks of Las Piedras, allegedly Venezuela, a posse of foreign deadbeats is vegetating under the blistering sun, jobless and hankering for a plane ticket to leave the purgatory, they are churlish opportunists and rowdy bar brawlers, among them stands the French ladies' man Mario (a sexpot Montand), who toys with the affection of the barmy barmaid Linda (Mme Clouzot in her film debut), and has no qualms about jilting his benevolent Italian roommate Luigi (Lulli, truly the salt-of-the-earth type), to hobnob with his blow-in compatriot, the ex-gangster Jo (Vanel), fancying an easy way out, but the truth is, Jo is also at the end of his rope. <br/><br/>A perilous job opportunity emerges when the American corporation Southern Oil Company needs to transport nitroglycerin to extinguish a massive fire in the oil fields, four drivers are chosen to drive two trucks in conveyance of the highly explosive products in a 300-mile rugged haul, with no safety precautions at hand The sideswipe of American capitalistic avarice and callousness is pretty much in your face, yet, for these hardscrabble expatriates, $2,000 is an offer too tempting to refuse, after some backhanded maneuver Jo gets the last spot to drive with Mario, while Luigi is paired with Bimba (Van Eyck, stolid and unbelievably cool), a taciturn German who endures a dark past.<br/><br/>Henceforth, Clouzot viz. the Gallic Hitchcock takes audience on an ensorceling edge-of-the-seat road trip where one single substantial bump can cause their trucks to be blown up to smithereens, like a ticking bomb hanging over our heads. Compelling set pieces, a gripping turn on the precipice, and detonating an obstructing rock, one mobile, one static, are textbook paragon of tension-building and suspense-eliciting, not to mention the effect graced by Georges Auric's captivating accidental music.<br/><br/>However, physical obstacles aside, it is the mental exertion that takes a heavy toll en route, Jo, the hard-nosed, savvy spiv, gradually yields to the mounting fear and his cowardice starts to turn Mario from his toady to a hectoring boss, sending contempt and verbal abuse to a humiliated Jo, up to a merciless last-ditch attempt knowingly leaving him mortally wounded, here Clouzot's astutely differentiates true grit from Dutch courage, and examines the phallocratic pride with utter acumen, its reverberations is astounding, much also owing to the two protagonists' unyielding tours-de-force, especially Vanel, completely devotes himself to the grueling condition (that petrol wallowing sequence is awestruck), and more credibly, he tenaciously enlivens Jo's transformation from a despicable wide boy to a resigned old geezer, for whose aftermath we feel deeply sympathetic. <br/><br/>Our compassion towards Montand's Mario also undergoes a sea change when the plot thickens, his raffish charm morphs into an admirable determination midway, until his ruthless color takes the upper hand, Montand perfectly showcases his marquee idol charisma, and his baptism-of-fire triumph is unqualifiedly hard-earned, but Clouzet ratchets up the morbid irony in its dizzy ending, as augured by its opening, the quartet's fate is hanging on the same thread, negligible, expendable and inescapable.<br/><br/>Incontrovertibly, THE WAGES OF FEAR is a daunting progenitor for late comers to emulate but impossibly to surpass, denotes a hefty import of Clouzot's unrivaled cinematic legacy, that reinvented narrative cinema with its high-octane vicariousness.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This is richer, tenser, more atmospheric, and in all ways a better film than Clouzot's next one, \"Les Diabolique\" - which is saying a lot.  I've never understood why Clouzot isn't more highly regarded.  Indeed, for a long time I simply couldn't believe that he wasn't.<br/><br/>One charge that hangs over his head is misogyny.  With regards to \"Les Diabolique\" this is simply ridiculous; with regards to \"The Wages of Fear\", I can see how one could harbour the uncomfortable feeling that there is, perhaps, something in it.  But what, really, does the evidence amount to? The fact that one of the heroes is inexcusably cruel to his girlfriend? It's not as if the film endorses this, or invites us to take pleasure in it, or even, for that matter, allows us to.  The characters are all flawed, and the film doesn't seek to deny it.  It does, however, make an attempt to explain it.  That town in the middle of nowhere is, we feel, really in the MIDDLE of nowhere; it must be the dustiest and most demoralising place on Earth.  After a while we feel as if we could start kicking someone, just to break the monotony.<br/><br/>There's no doubt that the initial monotony gives the rest of the film half its strength.  William Wyler once said that if you want to surprise or shock an audience the best thing you can do is bore them half to death beforehand - and although I can think of absolutely no reason why this should be so, allowing for a little exaggeration, it's true.  The seemingly aimless opening sequences help make every single frame, from the moment the nitro-glycerin is mentioned, electric.<br/><br/>So much is, in retrospect, amazing.  There's the way Clouzot manages to show us the humanity in these seemingly squalid people.  (Even the oil magnate, just when we think he's the world's most heartless capitalist, reveals he has a heart with an unexpected remark, and yet the remark doesn't feel at all out of character - it's the kind of masterful characterisation film-goers live for.)  Then there's the obstacles these drivers must face. All are memorable; most are so perfectly realised they deserve to be called mythic.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Four unsavory down-and-outs whiling away their hours in a poverty-stricken South American village accept the fool's errand of transporting two truckloads of nitroglycerin across terrible roads to an oil company accident site. Once some preliminary character development is disposed of and the men are on their way, the movie settles into one hell of a nail-biter, sort of a French, 1950s inversion of \"Speed\" -- if they go too fast, or make one false move, they go up in flames.<br/><br/>The first hour of \"The Wages of Fear\" is a marvel of production design. Director Clouzot packs his frame with things to look at, and the village, though built specifically for the movie, reeks of authenticity. The mise-en-scene alone is fascinating to watch -- some incidental action going on in the background of one shot (like a hothead smacking his girlfriend) is then picked up as the principal action in the next scene. And the Blu-Ray looks terrific; every mud puddle and heat-dazed fly is clear as a bell.<br/><br/>The second half of the film is pure suspense. It's a study in male machismo and one-upsmanship. The oldest member of the group, who struts around like Mr. Big Shot in the town when he has nothing to fear, crumples like a baby when faced with the prospect of death for real. But the movie doesn't let us be disdainful of him. As he says at one point, he's scared because he has enough life experience to know what death is, unlike the young hotshots who think to be frightened is to be weak.<br/><br/>Clouzot doesn't seem to have a rosy outlook on life, if the film's fatalistic ending is any indication. Or maybe he's just making the point that life is futile for men who approach it in a certain way.<br/><br/>\"The Wages of Fear\" feels way ahead of its time, both in style and substance. I had trouble believing that it was actually made in 1953.<br/><br/>Grade: A</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Georges Arnaud's novel LE SALAIRE DE LA PEUR has been filmed twice, by Henri-Georges Clouzot as THE WAGES OF FEAR (1953) and by William Friedkin as SORCERER (1977). While both films are worth seeing, the earlier version is the one regarded as a classic, and rightly so. Although SORCERER goes into more detail about the political climate and the various misdeeds that led the four desperate protagonists to the South American hellhole where they accept high-paying but life-risking jobs driving nitroglycerin through treacherous terrain, WAGES... distinguishes the men's personalities better, giving the audience more rooting interest in them. Both films have excellent casts, with charismatic leads in Yves Montand (WAGES...) and Roy Scheider (SORCERER), plus WAGES... also provides feminine charm in the form of beguiling Vera Clouzot as the café waitress who loves Montand. Both films have tense action sequences as well, but somehow for all the staging and skillful editing, SORCERER's action scenes seem strangely slow, slogging along in the mud just like the protagonists in their less-than-state-of-the-art trucks. Both versions have enough good things in them to be worth a look, but if you only have the time and resources to check out one of them, it's WAGES... that really pays off!</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This movie is astonishing, a gritty story filmed in an ultra-real style that relies simply on the beauty of lighting and film to achieve its stunning effects. It seems from another world, which in a way, it is. The acting is superb: Montand's Mario is full of jerky movements and intense impulses but always maintains his Gallic savoir-faire, while Charles Vanel as Jo brings, at first at least, a type of macho to the screen that modern movie-makers simply do not comprehend. The rest of the cast, especially the camp chief, Luigi, and Peter van Eyck as Bimba are incredible, as is Vera Clouzot who is incomprehensibly but believably upbeat and innocent - and totally gorgeous - in the midst of the hellhole of a town they're all stuck in. Clouzot's directing is flawless - I don't think anyone has ever squeezed more tension with just a few essential scene elements. The trucks wheeze and grunt as well as they ever have in the movies - the only comparison is Spielberg's early gem, \"The Duel\", but Clouzot's automotive cinematics outdo even Spielberg. The stripped down existentialism of the characters, the starkness of their shared dilemma, the grim and grimy scenery, and the cinematography itself are all of a piece. The latter is what elevates this movie to the very top rank, including some of the most dramatic and effective black and white shooting I've ever seen. Yet it never becomes mannered or gratuitous - it is orchestrated with the rise - and rise! - of tension in the film. The final scene takes on a surreal as opposed to ultra-realistic quality that has its own logic. One last word about the acting - we don't see anything like it anymore. The self-conscious mannerism of method acting (which has had its own triumphs) and the toxic awareness of everyone from the actors to the audience, the camera, directors, etc. that each actor is a celebrity and potential artiste, has ruined that conviction that actors were once larger than life people before they went on-screen, that they came to acting as an outcome of living rough, unadorned, and yet imaginative lives as opposed to shooting for fame and fortune and celebrity within an artificial corporate star-making incubator.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">In a shanty town somewhere in Latin America, men come from all over the world to run away and hide. Jobs are scarce and hunger is common. They are free to walkabout but soon realise that the town is one big prison as any of the men lack money to get a ticket to fly out of here.<br/><br/>Salvation comes in the form of an oil field fire several hundred miles away. The task is to drive two trucks packed with nitroglycerine explosives to put it out, but the roads are treacherous one nasty bump and the truck can go boom. Hopefully one of the trucks can make it through, the prize is $2000 each to any of the drivers make it to the oil field fire and deliver their cargo.<br/><br/>Corsican Mario and the much older Jo drive the heaviest truck. Mario flirts with the waitress in the local bar. Jo is a new arrival on the run from Paris with a reputation as a gangster. However once they start their treacherous journey, Jo gets the shakes and is frightened. It is Mario who is determined to finish the journey.<br/><br/>Director Henri-Georges Clouzot made a classic film of men putting their lives at risk for money but it is also a character study as well. Mario is at first in awe of Jo as he arrives in the small town. Jo persuades Mario to get on this venture and he will show him the ropes. When the drive begins, Mario is initially frightened but gets the upper hand and starts to bully Jo around as age has finally caught up with him and Jo is scared.<br/><br/>The film starts off in a leisurely manner as we see these disparate group of men, bored, causing trouble at the local bar. The tension soon mounts as four of the men begin their dangerous journey.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Henri-Georges Clouzot is probably most famous for his atmospheric mystery drama 'Les Diaboliques', but just as good is this film; Wages of Fear. The film gives a commentary on the things that people will do for money, and it follows a treacherous journey across South America for two two-men teams of truckers transporting nitroglycerine across the continent for an American oil company, on the promise of $2000 when they reach their destination. The men taking this task on know very well what the risks are, but they decide to do it anyway just because they need the dough. Rather than just feeding us this premise, however, the great maestro has opted to make sure that we fully understand the situation that our protagonists are in. The first hour of the film just sees the main characters in their native village, scrimping and slowly killing themselves just to make enough money to live on. These guys have to drink lemonade when they go to their local drinking establishment, and this image of themselves is putting them on the back foot further still, as no one in the town will employ the people that they see as tramps. This back building gives the audience something that the main crux of the story wouldn't have otherwise; and that's understanding from the audience.<br/><br/>Once the action starts properly, Clouzot really lets rips with his awesome directorial talent. Like he did with Les Diaboliques two years later; he really shows that he knows the meaning of suspense. The nitroglycerine loaded trucks in the movie could explode with the slightest vibration, and once again Clouzot makes sure that you understand the situation. The movie firmly balances itself on a short string, and any minute the leads could go up in flames; which gives the action a very potent degree of tension and suspense at all times, even when there isn't all that much going on. There are some very good stunts in the movie, however, and things such as the oil lake and the huge boulder in the middle of the road represent the best of them. The characters are both well introduced and well rounded, and Clouzot has given each of the four main men in the film their own distinctive character and because of the extensive situation building that the director gave us towards the start of the movie, we always care for them; which helps the movie no end when it comes to the more touching moments of the story. On the whole, this is a GREAT motion picture. It's a lesson in suspense and it's a film that anyone who considers themselves to be a fan of thrillers should see.</div>\n",

This 1953 French classic tells the story of a bunch of guys who are stuck in a squalid South American village--a sort of Casablaca-esque purgatory--and will do anything to get out, even if it means getting themselves blown sky high. Slow and lazy for the first half (deliberately), the plot eventually reveals itself to be about a suicide mission to haul a zillion gallons of nitroglycerine across 300 miles of harsh terrain that would make the Coyote &amp; Roadrunner take an early retirement.<br/><br/>Yes, nitro is that stuff that you don't want to look at the wrong way or it may send you to the moon. \"Wages of Fear\" ultimately reveals itself to be a gripping character study of how people keep their wits, or come unravelled, when subjected to pure terror... with of course the reward of heaven dangling just out of reach. So again we see this subtle allegory of purgatory, hell and heaven which I'm sure was the intent of director Henri-Georges Clouzot.<br/><br/>An interesting point of historical note is that when this film was released in the USA, around 15 minutes of its 150 min running time were cut. According to the Criterion mini-documentary \"Censored\", these cuts were largely due to the \"anti-American\" themes (the tyrannical oil corporation that exploits the lives of locals for the sake of a buck) as well as subtle themes of spiritual cynicism (the beautifully poetic \"fence\" monologue which symbolizes the absence of God/afterlife). By today's standards these censored scenes are prime time tv, but back in the 50s this movie was feared by US censors as being godless pinko propaganda. That might put a smirk on your face as you're watching this flick. But definitely look for the full 150ish minute version of this film, not the 130 min censored cut.<br/><br/>But really, for the entire second half there will be no smirking, only tense gritting of teeth as you watch these rolling nuke trucks inch across the South American jungle. The hazards they encounter, as well as their ingenious attempts to survive them, are extremely creative and expertly filmed with the sort of suspense that would make Hitchcock lose his breath.<br/><br/>Content advisory stuff: There's a scene in the beginning where a fine tarantula specimen gets squashed. After rewinding and rewatching the scene in slo-mo a dozen times, I'm almost certain that our unfortunate arachnid was a fake prop. If anyone knows differently please mention it in a review. The same scene shows a naked woman from behind, at a distance. Later in the film is a scene that shows a topless native woman from a distance--it's very artistic. Language is tame throughout the movie with maybe 1 or 2 instances of \"merde\" (the sh- word). While there is violence, none of it is shown explicitly on camera (some of it is disturbing, though). And unless you're a 1950s American censorship bureaucrat, there's nothing politically incendiary other than the notion that the almighty dollar is the root of much misery.<br/><br/>\"Wages of Fear\" is a well crafted, poetic, suspenseful film that certainly deserves its classic status in the history of cinema. Not unlike the classic Bogart/Lupino film \"They Drive by Night\" (1940), this film proves that a seemingly simple story about a bunch of truck drivers can really get your gears going.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Whoever it may be to rightly claim that he invented the action thriller genre (Méliès, I suppose), Henri-Georges Clouzot's \"Le salaire de la peur\" is an indispensable milestone on the exciting route to the best films of that kind in the 70's, 80's and nowadays. In its tenseness, as symbolized by the danger of explosion of the lorries' loads, it has hardly been surpassed.<br/><br/>The plot is perfectly worked out from start to end, the leading players act in some of their best parts ever, the (almost) absence of music supports the brutal realism and the consequent choice of authentic outdoor settings contributed a lot to the film's deserved success. Historically, it ranges between neorealismo and nouvelle vague, and yet it is its pure action and suspense that make it worth watching for younger audiences who wouldn't go in for just the artistic way. - Only flaw I can see is the curious, rather artificial change in Vanel's character which has no comprehensible motivation, at least for me whenever I see it.<br/><br/>Apart from that, Clouzot's wife Véra (also well-known from his \"Les diaboliques\") plays to the \"most breathtaking angles\" gallery when she bows down to scrub the floor of Dario Moreno's gin joint. It's a man's world after all and there are male perspectives on human survival only. Well, it's existentialism, mates. Altogether, the black and white photography is gripping. The gun scene between Lulli and Vanel is one of the best montages in film history, and there is more excellent editing in \"Salaire\" (including the finale) that completely fits the hot atmosphere.</div>\n",

When I rented the DVD and read the story it sounded familiar, because I had watched the newer version before in color with Roy Scheider, which was good as well. But watching the original film truly blew me away. This movie is well made in every detail. It puts a lot of detail-work in the creation of the characters, and once you think that is over and the \"regular action-part\" starts, it becomes even better and the story takes a 90 degree turn! After I had finished watching the entire movie, I needed at least 5 minutes just to \"digest\" it and rethink this fantastic film. If you got a chance to watch it, don't miss it! It is entertaining from the first to the last minute!</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I've often heard of Clouzot referred to as the 'French Hitchcock' although this film seems to share more of a cousin hood with the work of John Houston.<br/><br/>Wages of Fear is about how a bunch of immigrants in Latin America, for money, take on the reckless task of transporting a large consignment of explosive nitroglycerin across 300-miles of obstacle-riddled paths, every moment aware that a single concussion could ignite the entire shipment, blowing them all to bits.<br/><br/>The film begins with the setting of the locale and introduction of its principal characters - the regular irregulars Mario and Luigi (just realized the striking similarity to Nintendo's famous plumber duo, hmm), the mafioso type new entrant Jo who strikes up a friendship with the raffish Mario becoming his mentor but antagonizes the rest of the townsfolk with his bossy attitude, Mario's mistress Linda who naively worships him but is in turn kept as a pleasure item. The town is a dead-end rife with poverty and unemployment, its only industry being the Southern Oil Corporation (SOC) a Yankee enterprise. The residents are too demoralized to even consider escape to better climes. Like Mario explains to Jo in the course of a brilliantly spliced sequence of jump-cuts that covers the entire aspect of the town, \"It's like prison. Easy to get in, but escape is impossible.\"<br/><br/>A major fire at the oil-wells calls for immediate shipment of explosive to isolate the blaze, but it's too late to bring in the specialized transportation. The company offers a payment of $2000 each for 4 locals who will carry the hazardous shipment in ordinary trucks. Mario, Jo, Luigi and a Jew Bimba take on the job, the promise of money to help them escape from the town sufficient even to temporarily offset the fear of death. Thus begins the arduous, tension-ridden journey that occupies most of this 148-min film. The trucks must move above a certain minimum speed to minimize vibrations (a ruse reused in 1994's Speed). On the way they face various blocks including a rickety wooden bridge the trucks must back up over. Mid-journey one of the trucks blows up. Mario and Jo who are in the other truck must overcome their horror at the catastrophe and cross further hurdles including a lake of oil created by the bursting of a pipeline.<br/><br/>In the course of the journey we see a reversal in the roles of Jo and Mario. Initially Mario looks up to Jo, in awe of his cool and worldly-wise manner. But Jo is soon revealed to be in reality a scared old man for whom Mario has only a contemptuous pity. This character drama makes for engrossing viewing and in no small measure due to the excellent performances, especially Charles Vanel as Jo.<br/><br/>The story moves smoothly thanks to very precise cutting, and some of the nighttime photography, as also the scene at the oil lake, is worth mentioning. Clouzot obviously has a sure hand over the bulk of the proceedings although he slips up in a couple of places: The oil company is portrayed in a rather ham-fisted (and badly acted) way as this evil uncaring monolith that would gladly blame dead employees for disasters to avoid compensation and resort to thoroughly unethical means to get its job done. Most of the supporting characters are cardboard. Also, some of the miniature work is painfully obvious, although that'd be likely a limitation of technical facilities available to the crew. The ending of the film is finely executed but seems all too contrived to give you your daily dose of irony.<br/><br/>In the end, this remains a taut and finger-licking good old-school thriller, which bothers to provide characters interesting enough for us to care about their life and death.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">A director of several terrific detective movies made in the forties such as \"le corbeau\" (1943), you can consider Henri Georges Clouzot as one of the best French film-makers specialized in suspense. Here, he broaches a new topic for him: the adventure movie with \"le salaire de la peur\" (1953) and this is a stunning movie.<br/><br/>You can divide the movie into two obvious parts. The first one focuses on this bunch of men who lives in this Mexican small town cut disconnected from the world, even the time. If this part is a little uninteresting (but essential in the way that Clouzot emphasizes on their boredom and the mission to carry nitroglycérine with trucks to an oil well is an unexpected opportunity for them), on the other hand, the second part justifies the vision of the movie. When the four men have accepted the mission, they aren't out of the woods: there are a lot of dangerous situations where death can arrive at any moment. Clouzot manages to maintain the interest thanks to an asset whose he is the master: the suspense.<br/><br/>A brilliant and absorbing movie still just as good as it was more than fifty years ago.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Splendid and famous movie by Henry-Georges Clouzot and remade by William Friedkin as ¨Sorcerer¨ in 1977 . Dealing with four distressed men (Yves Montand , Charles Vanel , Folco Lulli , Peter Van Eyck) who undertake a risked journey throughout the Amazon jungle by transporting a hazardous cargo . As an American company : ¨Southern Oil Company¨ controls a desolate Central American town whose citizens desperately want money to live , so desperately that four are willing to attempt a suicide mission to deliver nitroglycerine to put out a well-fire raging 300 miles away . As the company's cynical head has offered 2000 dollars to each man , enough to finance theit getaway from the hell-hole they live in .<br/><br/>Exciting and thrilling movie which so entrapped us in following the misfortunes of the four men desperate enough to undertake a suicidal journey with a cargo of nitroglycerine along the dangerous jungle and cliffside roads . Multi-dimensional , twisted and complex drama concentrates on character development for the first half . The film contains nail-biting scenes as the cliff frames when a truck is hooked or the petroleum hole , crucial to the movie's greatness . Main role is grittily played by Yves Montand giving a wonderful acting . The remainder of the roles remain perfectly developed such as Charles Vanel , Folco Lulli , Peter Van Eyck and special appearance by Vera Clouzot , George Clouzot's wife .<br/><br/>It packs a strirring and moving musical score by Georges Auric . As well as evocative and atmospheric black/white cinematography shot on location by cameraman Armand Thirard and in a finely restored version . The motion picture based on a novel written by Georges Arnaud was competently directed by Henry Georges Clouzot . He started his film career as a screenwriter and then Henri-Georges Clouzot switched over to directing in 1942 with Tout pour l'amour and The Murderer Lives at Number 21 . His films are typically relentless suspense thrillers , similar to Alfred Hitchcock's but with far less light relief . He had the distinction of having his film The craven (1943) prohibited by both the German forces occupying France and the Free French forces fighting them, but for different reasons . He shot to international fame with Jenny Lamour (1947) and especially Wages of fear (1953) and consolidated that success with other films as Race for Life (1956) , Les espions (1957) , La prisonnière (1968) . He beat Alfred Hitchcock in buying the rights to \"Les Diaboliques\"(1955) with a margin of just a few hours , but continuous ill health caused large gaps in his output , and several projects had to be abandoned until his death . Rating : 7.5/10 . Better than average . And it had a good remake by William Friedkin with Roy Scheider , Bruno Cremer , Francisco Rabal and Amidou.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The name of the game in 'The Wages Of Fear (1953)' is suspense: pure adrenaline-pumping, white-knuckled, edge-of-your-seat suspense. Of course, its hugely extended set-pieces aren't the only thing that make the movie great. There's a surprising amount of solid character work, especially when it comes to one particular character who ends up revealing himself to be the total opposite of what he is initially set up to be. It's a remarkable transition and it showcases some really solid acting skills (you've never seen anyone act scared until you've seen this). After a relatively slow opening that makes a point of portraying the lacklustre employment prospects of the town that our unconventional characters are stuck in, the piece kicks into gear and gets a handful of its players started on a journey that turns every bump in the road, every shift in suspension, every pebble in their path into deadly obstacles. This situation is milked for all it's worth; it grips you and never lets you go, forcing your heart into your mouth more times than you can count. It's soaked in dread, too. The film is definitely one of the - if not the - most suspenseful that I've ever seen. Frankly, it's a masterpiece. Though its first half is fairly slow, nowhere near as compelling as its second and showcases a couple of major characters who display some blatant sexism and racism, the affair is ultimately an affecting and memorable thrill ride.

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">\"Le Salaire de le Peur\" (\"The Wages of Fear\") is a harrowing journey of four men going down in bumpy roads, miserable places, won over by the most difficult obstacles, a long way performing their jobs transporting a great load of dynamite to be used on a burning oil well. It's a job, it pays well, those guys are the best in it but it's a hard, dangerous and exhausting service that can cost their lives. All the way, almost like descending to hell. This is the road to hell. It's a story about the battle between courage and cowardice and how fear can take over even the bravest of souls. This is Henri-Georges Clouzot masterpiece along with the equally brilliant \"Les Diaboliques\", both featuring a tension that rises into an endless crescent that never leaves you at ease.<br/><br/>I saw \"Sorcerer\" (the American remake), read Georges Arnaud's novel and watched this film. To me, they all stand on the same level. They're incredibly good, very exciting but they're not great. Arnaud focus more on the mission's perils rather than the characters and sometimes the story doesn't turn to other interesting possibilities; neither Clouzot or Friedkin films are the book, lacking of some of its good ideas but developing some new ones.\"Sorcerer\" is an adventure about mercenaries looking for money and thrilling experiences while \"The Wages of Fear\" is a human drama about desperate people risking their lives to earn a living in the only possible way, and therefore more realistic than its remake. <br/><br/>But Clouzot is a master in creating scary and real danger at practically every frame. A bar fight against local power man; the training closely observed by their patrons with conductors sabotaging each other; a truck making a difficult turn in a place that threats to collapse at any moment; the fear in the drivers eyes and hands, maneuvering as if each turn could be the last. The director delivers one of the most inspired and frightening moments of all time (not present in the book) when a giant stone stands on their way and the solution found to remove it to use part of the explosives. Heart couldn't handle very well that scene so perfectly made, with no soundtrack, very few dialogs and a constant action. And you relate very easily with the characters struggle, amazingly performed by Yves Montand (and I could never imagine him in such role, one of his earliest), Charles Vanel, Peter van Eyck and Folco Lulli, similar in being all afraid of what they're doing but their fears are expressed in many different ways. Some panic, some control it, others disguise from time to time trying to look adventurous. <br/><br/>The difficulties I had with this were the erratic and long introduction of each character, too many humored bits that weren't so effective (those could have been easily trimmed down) and the ending - not in the sense of being a let down but its goofy presentation seems awkward. The treatment given to the theme, the heart of the matter which is their mission and the rest (even the romance involving Montand and the girl, which is slightly distractive but useful) achieves a positive result. Certainly a movie of a different level and exciting even today. 21st Century flicks can only aspire to be something like this. Call me crazy, but Hollywood can even try again with a remake but this time read the novel, make wise choices and you might reach something similar or better. There's themes that can be explored in a very interesting way to make it a more challengeable film and adventurous. 9/10</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The triangle of sadness is that space right above the nose and between the eyebrows that can get all bunched up when someone is worried, or angry, or confused. We're told this in the opening moments of \"Triangle of Sadness\" when a male model is asked to relax his during an audition. That model, Carl, played by Harris Dickinson, is dating Yaya (the late Charlbi Dean), a social media influencer, and the first chapter of this film, titled \"Carl and Yaya,\" consists almost entirely of the two of them bickering. Carl is vaguely frustrated by the dynamic in their relationship and feels manipulated by Yaya, but in ways he can never clearly articulate. He thinks they fall too quickly into stereotyped gender norms, but every time Yaya tries to correct the situation, he gets angry and tells her she's not getting the point. Does Carl have a valid beef with Yaya, or is he just being a jerk? Yaya admits that she's manipulative and confesses to feeling contrite about it, but is she really? And in any case, do I care about the not super important tribulations of these vapid people, and do I want to spend two and a half hours watching them?<br/><br/>But don't worry. Chapter 2 comes along, and Carl and Yaya's relationship quickly becomes secondary. This part is titled \"The Yacht,\" and puts us on a luxury cruise with Carl and Yaya and a bunch of other people who will reveal themselves to be insufferable representatives of the rich and.....if not famous, then....well.....really, really rich.<br/><br/>The big set piece of this chapter is the captain's dinner, presided over by Woody Harrelson, who eats a hamburger and fries while everyone else eats squiggly sea creatures and disturbingly colorless jellies. He'll be glad he made that choice, because the seas get rocky. Things go quickly down the toilet from there. Except for the things that don't make it to the toilet in time. And the things that come up from the toilet in all of their liquid and ghastly detail. Seriously, this section of the movie made me queasy for a whole day afterwards every time I even looked at food.<br/><br/>You wouldn't think it could get much worse, but it does. We eventually get to chapter 3, \"The Island,\" which finds a handful of survivors who've escaped an exploding yacht (long story) establishing a new social order until help arrives. This is where the movie kicks into full gear, and we start to understand better everything that came before. This is also where the actress Dolly De Leon emerges almost literally out of nowhere to steal the movie out from under everyone else. She plays Abigail, \"toilet manager\" on the cruise, but now queen bee, because she's the only one who has any practical skills. She can catch fish with her bare hands, make fires, cook. What happens when the social order is entirely upended? Abigail gives us a glimpse. What good are your Rolex watches when the most desired commodity becomes a bag of pretzel sticks? As Abigail establishes herself as matriarchal leader of this ragtag civilization, all of those navel gazing conversations about gender roles that Carl and Yaya were having way back at the beginning start to have more meaning, and their fraught relationship directly affects the direction things take.<br/><br/>This is all capped off by one of those ambiguous endings that some people will love and that will send others across the internet into a froth of rage.<br/><br/>\"Triangle of Sadness\" is not especially profound satire. It doesn't have anything to say about rich people that a million other movies haven't already said, and what it does say it says obviously and heavy handedly. But give me any movie about privileged, entitled people being made aware of their helplessness and I'm on board. And this film is right on the nose about what happens when the lower classes get a taste of the power they wield. I mean, during the pandemic, when people in service jobs couldn't work or decided not to, we saw a whole population of affluent Americans lose their minds at the thought of not having enough toilet paper. Just imagine if there had been a shortage of pretzel sticks.<br/><br/>This is a fiendishly entertaining movie and makes up in gumption what it lacks in subtlety.<br/><br/>Grade: A.</div>\n",

Without anything in particular dramatic happening at all, a FASCINATING tension / intrigue was slowly building up inside this story. THAT's the trademark of a brilliant writer and director!<br/><br/>This is definitely a director's gem!<br/><br/>This director manages to evoke feelings, evoke thoughts, with mere images and without any logical explanation. It is such a joy to watch this mindbending story unfold!<br/><br/>The photography needs special mentioning, because it was like a fly on the wall. Subtle, but suggestive. Mysterious and mesmirizing. I was drawn in like rarely happens. I was mesmirized!<br/><br/>However great the buildup in eery tension was during the first part of this movie, the final segment of this story was a bit of a let down, because the eery tension was gone. Still fascinating to watch the final unfold and there will surely be a LOT of moral analysis WHAT this picture is all about. But in the end this is what I simply would like to call BRILLIANT CINEMA.<br/><br/>BRAVO!<br/><br/>Thank you for reading my 1800th review on Imdb!</div>\n",

No stone is left unturned as you move through society's expectations of class, money and sexual politics. This is not light breezy fun and is sure to turn your stomach just watching it at times. This is a return to an original script not based on some comic book or sequel of some long drawn out franchise. I mean you could watch another DC/Marvel movie but is there a point to that anymore?

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">First of all, there is no earthly reason this movie needs to be 2 hours and 27 minutes. None. 147 minutes of beating home with sledgehammer efficiency, the prevalence of socio-economic injustice, the perverse obsession with the superficial over the substantial, and gender inequity. The exposing and mocking of which, I am 100% supportive! But the execution is so lazy and repetitive that, even though the core message is admirable, this can hardly be considered enjoyable, much less enlightening.<br/><br/>Now, I love a slow burn. I like long films. And I definitely like films that have something to say. But in all honesty, this film could have been cut by 1/3rd and spared the audience a lot of pain. Every scene is too long, starting from the very first one. There certainly is a message of gender-reversed exploitation to be made, but how long does it really need to take? And the awkwardness of Carl and Yaya's evening is excruciatingly drawn out, exacerbated by the dull and fractional dialogue (though this could be mitigated by the characters being dull and fractional themselves). Even the aftermath of the Captain's Dinner is gratuitously long and boring (I won't even bring in 'disgusting', because that frankly isn't even the issue.) It must be meant for an audience unfamiliar with subtlety in film, but there's no way that target audience has the attention span for such a drawn out film.<br/><br/>Only the 3rd chapter (which deep down somewhere, I knew *had* to be coming, though I'd hoped credits would role at the end of Chapter 2) was even remotely interesting. Two hours of laborious setup to reveal what we already knew in the first place, and had been very obviously foreshadowed from the first moments on the yacht. Take a bit of The Menu and add some Lord of the Flies, but the total is less than the sum of its parts.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Triangle of Sadness has received much critical acclaim and comes around with a plot that sounds interesting on paper. The truth is however that this movie is vapid, pretentious and exhausting drivel that doesn't deserve the attention it's getting. Let me point out how I have come to this conclusion.<br/><br/>First of all, the movie exaggeratedly tries to criticize contemporary society. The world of modeling is fake and superficial. Influencers are self-consumed and shallow. The rich and famous are greedy and soulless. The poor are jealous and vengeful. This movie brings up so many tired old stereotypes that it doesn't become a satire of contemporary society but rather a satire of its very own kind: pretentiously moralizing films attempting to please trendy prejudices.<br/><br/>Up next, this film is unbearably long and clocks in at two and a half hours. We are witnessing models doing a casting for ten minutes. We are watching a toxic couple arguing over financial matters for twenty minutes. We are introduced to a whole range of characters on a yacht for forty-five minutes. Depth there is none. Development there is none. Entertainment there is none.<br/><br/>The characters are meant to be antipathic. However, they are never fleshed out and remain dreadfully shallow to a point that viewers will simply not care about their fates at all. Their actions, discussions and motivations keep repeating themselves endlessly. Few movies have ever had so many redundant dialogues as this one.<br/><br/>The acting performances also remain mostly shallow. A positive exception is Dolly de Leon who shines as manipulative antagonist in the last third of the movie but is nowhere to be seen before. Harris Dickinson disappoints as protagonist since he doesn't have any charisma whatsoever. His looks are boring, his facial expressions are repetitive and his delivery is redundant. That isn't anything new however since he already couldn't convince in previous features such as The King's Man and See How They Run. Lead actress Charlbi Dean tragically died much too young. If we strictly talk about her acting skills however, she also doesn't have the charisma to carry this movie. She often overacts in an artificial way which becomes nerve-firing through two and a half hours. She never becomes one with her role and instead establishes a distance to it that makes it obvious that she is acting. Talented actresses and actors on the other side are underused in this movie. Woody Harrelson is limited to the role of a drunk captain who keeps yelling nonsense through a closed cabin door time and again. Iris Berben is limited to repeating the same seven words over and over again since she is playing a character that suffered from a stroke and can't express herself very well. The casting choices for this movie have been absolutely dreadful in my opinion.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, I would highly recommend you to avoid watching Triangle of Sadness. This movie doesn't live up to its exaggeratedly positive reception. This film doesn't even know what it wants to be: adventure film, black comedy, survival drama, contemporary satire, you name it. Ultimately, this film is nothing but bloated, pretentious and shallow. Even its concept offers nothing new. You would be much better off reading Lord of the Flies or even Robinson Crusoe if you are interested in an analysis of society in a context of isolation. If you absolutely want to watch a contemporary movie with a similar concept, go for Chinese production The Island. The movie is good to very good but compared to the disasterpiece Triangle of Sadness, it almost feels like watching a masterpiece.</div>\n",

The cinematic equivalent of a western teenager wearing a Che Guevara t-shirt to their private school.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly the disconnected Cannes audience ate it up. Awarding it, celebrating it and then popping back to their yachts in the harbour to demand cold champagne and hot massages from \"the staff\".</div>\n",

The humorousness scenes did most of the time not work for me, also there is at least one hour that you could easily cut and it would improve the affair a lot. Till we get on the ship we get bored to death with a lot of mostly useless and unnecessary scenes after scenes. The commentaries on society and capitalism, well, have the depth and subtlety of an election flyer of some left-wing party. And last but not least, some of the scenes and dialogues are really cringe-worthy. Well, if you try to make art, there is always the possibility to fail.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I kept seeing rave reviews coming out of Fantastic Fest 2022 for 'Triangle of Sadness' and it has been on my radar ever since. I saw it was slightly on the longer side in terms of run times so it took me a little while to find the time to watch it. I'm so glad I did though. This is one of the best films I've seen all year.<br/><br/>I mentioned that the film was long, however I didn't want it to end. I find a lot of these drawn out 150+ minute films drag and I'm constantly checking my watch. Here though, I would've happily sat through another 3 segments of film with these characters.<br/><br/>The film is wickedly smart. It's not out to be subtle with its social messages, but I think that's why it works so well. It's so forthright with them that they can't be taken too seriously. I never felt like the film was trying to preach at me. It was more a case of making fun of generalisations in a hilarious way.<br/><br/>Finally, the film is very funny. If you only watch one scene of a movie from 2022 make it the Captain's Dinner from 'Triangle of Sadness'. I haven't laughed that hard in a long time. This film was very, very good. 9.5/10.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The winner of the 2022 Cannes Film Festival's coveted Palme d'Or prize, Ruben Östlund's Oscar nominated latest slice of melancholy and home truths about the human condition is going to be a divisive exercise for audiences as the Swedish director examines the divide between the haves and the have nots in an epic darkly comedic operation that will likely ensure it's sometime between trips to your local seafood market.<br/><br/>Flirting the line between dramatic beats and Monty Python like physical comedy and outlandish situations, Östlund's Triangle of Sadness is broken up into multiple chapters, with the central figures to the story being Harris Dickinson's down on his luck model Carl and his influencer girlfriend Yaya (played by the late Charlbi Dean who sadly passed away not long after the films release) as the two find themselves aboard a luxury yacht captained by Woody Harrelson's unpredictable literature loving overseer who is going to provide the cruise's guests with numerous unforgettable memories.<br/><br/>In no hurry across its questionably extensive two and half hour runtime, many will not be able to predict where Sadness is going as it slowly and surely wanders along its narrative that around the midway point provides viewers with some of the most unexpected and eye-popping cinematic moments of recent memories as Östlund's razor sharp social commentary takes hold and the journey of Carl, Yaya and the cruise's many guests and staff crash headfirst in an explosive way, leading to various revelations and contemplation's for the films colourful characters.<br/><br/>Headlined well by rising star Dickinson and the taken too soon Dean, who you sense was destined for big things following this effort, Sadness finds some fantastic moments courtesy of Östlund's award worthy screenplay and some fantastic turns from the likes of Dolly De Leon as softly spoken ship handmaid Abigail, Zlatko Buric as Russian millionaire Dimitry (stealing the films best scene courtesy of a P. A system) and the always enjoyable Harrelson, who as per usual makes the most of any screen time he has given as a man who appears to have had enough of playing along with mandatory niceties.<br/><br/>With so much to enjoy and unpack across Sadness's extensive runtime, there is a strong sense that Östlund's feature runs out of steam in the latter stages and while it's best that viewers head into Sadness as blind as possible, once the films last chapter takes hold there are less wins for the narrative as we begin to look forward to a neat wrap up that comes in the form of one of the more abrupt endings of 2022, one that is likely to cause significant debate amongst the film community, much like the film as a whole that some will adore and others loathe.<br/><br/>Final Say -<br/><br/>Providing us with some of the more memorable genuinely hilarious moments of any film from the last 12 months, Triangle of Sadness is a unique feature film from one of the most individual voices in world cinema and while the film does run out of steam in its endgame, Östlund's film is still another fine addition to an increasingly impressive resume of releases.<br/><br/>4 hand grenades out of 5.<br/><br/>Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)</div>\n",

Being greedy all and all and the server cast who exist just to please them.<br/><br/>It is probably the intention to leave up to the viewer to decide if character is being serious, unintentionally funny or absurdly self-deprecating.

But the thing is, it can be done with much less screen time. You don't have to drag it out for more than 2 hours. There's so many useless scenes in this movie. I kept fast forwarding while watching, yet I still get the gist of it. And while it's interesting to see how the social ladder gets turned upside down, it's not interesting seeing dragged for so long. It gets boring and dull. Plus there wasn't any admirable character in this movie that the audience would want to root for. They're all just lowlifes. I don't know about you, but I don't enjoy watching immoral people doing the dirty. So for me, this movie is a big NOPE. For you who enjoy this kind of stuff, good for you. Enjoy it. I'd rather find something with more morality in it. Cause this world is already bleak without more bleak messages like this one. I'd rather not see more of these.</div>\n",

It is one of those movies where I wonder what I don't see what is so obvious to others. It is like being in a modern art museum and watching this huge painting which is just a white surface with one red and blue line running over it. It eludes me what people see in it and I always suspect the maker to be hiding behind some column laughing at all of us. The emperors clothes.<br/><br/>As for the story, the first part begins with a very boring fashion contest, then there is this couple bickering about who will pay the bill for the restaurant. Then we are on a luxury yacht with rich people amusing themselves and later getting into trouble in bad weather. I failed to see anything funny. And finally some of the rich passengers and a cleaning lady are on an island where the cleaning lady is the only one with skills to survive catching fish and making a fire. She requires some intimate services from the man of the couple. And that's it. What am I missing?</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">There has been a lot of buzz about Triangle of Sadness, especially given that it won the prestigious Palm D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Generally, however, reviews have been divided, with some calling it a hilarious anti-rich romp, and some criticizing it for being shallow in its satire.<br/><br/>But the problem with Triangle of Sadness has nothing to do with whether or not it is good dark comedy. The problem is that it's a complete mess. Annoying, disjointed, and appallingly slow, this is one of the most unpleasant cinemagoing experiences I've had all year. However, I can't deny that it is very well-made and acted, which saves the movie from outright badness.<br/><br/>The film starts off on the wrong foot with a long, long argument between its two protagonists. It's clearly supposed to show how shallow rich people are, but the scene should be around two minutes and instead takes up what feels like twenty. Both characters are intensely irritating: again, not on its own an issue, but it's not justified sufficiently to make it worthwhile.<br/><br/>Initially, you think to yourself \"no matter. A lot of movies don't start great. This is bound to get better.\" But, unfortunately, the opposite is true. Triangle of Sadness doesn't just have an overly long and slow beginning section, it's an overly long and slow movie. You find out that it scarcely has anything that resembles a plot or any real structure, and almost every single one of the characters are designed to be extremely unlikable. This leads to scene after scene of no consequence and little entertainment value, interspersed with only the occasional mildly amusing gag. Any through line established in the opening is completely dropped for no apparent reason. Even when the boat is finally left behind, the plot does not pick up whatsoever and still refuses to engage the audience.<br/><br/>What's most frustrating is that the elements for a great movie are right there. The acting is executed well and the movie is styled in a unique yet restrained way. Some of the humour even elicits laughs, a rare trait for a modern comedy. But none of this is enough to fully salvage the film and make it worth watching. Triangle of Sadness is a movie that has the trappings of great cinema, but it's all in service of a wretched, vacuous hole at its center.<br/><br/>Finally Score: 46/100.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This is a prime example of a movie that has clear ambitions yet misses the mark spectacularly. The best word that can describe Triangle of Sadness is \"snooty.\" From director Ruben Ostlund, it's a movie that thinks it has something new and important to say, when everything in it has already been said. It is also technically a dark comedy, but it's as funny as having nothing to do on an island. The only thing remotely funny in this movie was the scene with the hand grenade. That makes sense in context. It has a weird way of alternating between being ridiculously over the top and annoyingly ambiguous. The famed sinking scene where people vomit is the worst example of the former. Nobody needs to see a naked old man having diarrhea and vomiting on screen at the same time. It hits you over the head with its messages, and leaves the actual movie in the margins. The worst part is the ending, which doubles down on this. It's completely open-ended, without any hint of resolution.<br/><br/>It's quite clear what's being attempted here, but the response is always, \"so what?\" Probably the best example is the whole ordeal involving gender roles, which is featured at the beginning and the end. The movie starts with influencers Carl and Yaya arguing at a fancy restaurant over paying the bill. Then, at the end of the movie when they're stranded on an island, Carl starts having sex with Abigail, the toilet manager on the yacht, for extra food and privileges. It's pretty obvious that what we have here is an inversion of stereotypical gender roles and power structures. So what? What is Ostlund trying to say about this? It's not at all clear what the point is supposed to be. Another great example is the contrast between Thomas (an American socialist), and Dimitry (a Russian capitalist). Sure, it's conceptually interesting, but nothing is done with it. They argue as the yacht sinks, that's it.<br/><br/>The characters are horrible, they exist as mere caricatures, giving no reason to care about them or give room for any semblance of character development. No one is changed by the events taking place, they remain the same wooden stereotypes they started as. It's difficult to hate them, if that's the intention. It's like getting mad at the people on billboard ads. Now, one of the points is that these people have vapid and empty lives, but that doesn't mean they themselves need to be vapid and empty. Sure, the acting is good and it's great to see a cast of mostly unknown actors, but that doesn't change the fact that there is no substance to these characters. It's like a 2 and a half hour political cartoon.<br/><br/>There is always a certain hypocrisy in the movie industry making movies criticizing the rich and powerful. The very same lifestyles that movies like this criticize are the same ones that actors, directors, and executives live in while grandstanding about how much they care about poor people and social justice and what have you. They don't care, they never have, and as long as they continue making money, they never will. Also, who is going to see a movie like Triangle of Sadness? Aside from film nerds like me, it's the very same people that the movie is lambasting. It's a movie that tries to champion the working people made for high brow snobs, most of which are rich themselves. That's like starting a communist revolution in Bel-Air. This is a pretentious film made by pretentious people for other pretentious people.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I dislike this film. It's boring and random and one of the few films where I, personally, thought that the acting was stale. The overall movie is so much about \"delivering the message\" that plot nosedives and ends up becoming bland.<br/><br/>The story is not predictable, in a bad way. Just when you think that something interesting might take place or that an intriguing mystery will get revealed, the plot continues to move straightforward with the most obvious decisions. There's no subtleness nor any metaphors, this movie could've been shown as historical fiction docu-drama and I would've believed it cause the actual script reads like an edgy guy who just saw a couple of videos on different economical theories and decided to become Marxist or Socialist.<br/><br/>And the characters are shallow (which I guess was the point) and have almost no character development. Additionally, the actors themselves are just not feeling into it (especially the lead actors that play Carl and Yaya).<br/><br/>And the ending wasn't good too. Again, as I stated in the title, too on the nose and too hellbent on pushing the same message down the throat of the audiences, who I'm pretty sure will have gotten it by end of act 2.<br/><br/>Overall, don't know how or why this film is generating Oscar buzz, it certainly felt nowhere close to it. It's pretentious to its core and exhibits no sense of either fun or maturity, If you want to see a film that actually delivers this same message tastefully and with more fun, skip this and watch The Menu.<br/><br/>3 stars for a couple of chuckles here and there.<br/><br/>Not recommended.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Triangle of Sadness (or Sans Filtre) is most likely the best film Ruben Östlund has ever made. I say \"most likely\" because I'm actually a bit behind on this director, having only seen The Square when I was analyzing its screenplay for my degree project in 2019, ergo I couldn't take in its twisted satire or defiant imagery the way I would've liked.<br/><br/>Now, the Swedish legend takes his signature vibe -- pungent uneasiness that soon transitions into abject chaos -- out to sea. And let me tell you, if Titanic had involved a thundering storm instead of an iceberg and if instead of two young lovers trading sweet clichés we got copious cavalcades of sh-t and vomit, I'd get the hype a lot more.<br/><br/>A multinational production, the cast is rich and hails from all over the world. We first join two models, Carl (Harris Dickinson) and his more successful influencer girlfriend Yaya (the late Charlbi Dean), working in the modern fashion industry -- which is realistically depicted but subtly-yet-bitingly satirical like only Östlund knows how (here taking a few jabs at performative equality; companies boasting the DEI of their models who are all shaped about the same).<br/><br/>As they're invited to a luxury superyacht cruise along what seems to be the East African coast, we meet a multitude of other characters, including Woody Harrelson as the drunken ship's captain, Vicki Bergen as the head of staff, Dolly De Leon as a Filipino cleaning lady who becomes important later, and Zlatko Buric as a Russian oligarch. Between this and 2012, I conclude that \"boisterous Russian billionaire\" was simply the role Buric was born to play.<br/><br/>For me (and my fellow Swedish viewers, no doubt), it was especially fun to see revue legend Henrik Dorsin as a lonesome Swedish millionaire. He just has a perfect face and demeanor for comedy -- even the very first shot of him as a dejected, pudgy middle-aged man sitting by himself made me and my theater company laugh.<br/><br/>The main attraction in Triangle of Sadness is of course the Captain's Dinner scene, and even if you don't know what's about to happen, you'll suspect it from the start. The film builds it up perfectly; from the subtle tilt of the actors and props, showing the constant (and slowly increasing) instability of the yacht as the seas grow rougher, to the more and more noticeable ways in which the expressions and body language show onsetting nausea, everything flawlessly rises to when Hell at Sea is finally unleashed and all the pratfalls, emeses, and even diarrhea are so convincing I almost believed Östlund must have force-fed his crew ipecac and laxatives.<br/><br/>Of course, on top of being a grade-A example of escalatingly chaotic cringe comedy, its setting and characters allow plentiful commentary about billionaires, the industries that get them rich, and the very system that allows some human beings to have that much more than others in the first place. Even during the big \"barfing section\", these ideas appear -- more explicitly than ever, in fact. (The captain and the oligarch, being the only two who don't get seasick, stay behind in the dining hall to get piss-drunk and trade anti-capitalist vs. Anti-communist arguments, quotes, and platitudes, which they then start belting out over the intercom as they become friends and lock themselves inside the captain's office -- whilst the still panic-stricken passengers and crew are forced to listen as they soak in vomit and overflowing septic water.)<br/><br/>By circumstances I won't reveal (though I will say that they involve one of the most beautifully poetic and f-cked-up instances of \"Hoist by His Own Petard\" I have ever seen), a few of the characters wind up on a deserted island where all notions of social/class hierarchy have ceased to apply. This section of the film will be even more satisfying to some viewers (particularly those of a socialist persuasion), as the rich are robbed of their abundance and must subsist on base needs like everyone else.<br/><br/>But there is yet another layer: stripped of all their belongings, convinced that everyone is now equal and can distribute their resources in terms of need, the tiny society they form soon evolves to a point whereby it starts to resemble a prototype of the very system it sought to destroy. What this implies, I leave for you to decide.<br/><br/>The final shot of the film also invites much speculation. Where is our hero running? We can tell -- through basic cinematic language, as my companion pointed out -- that he must be pursuing the characters we saw leave earlier (he's running from the left side of the screen to the right, just as we see the others do throughout their hike) but what has happened? Does he know what the others discovered? Did that one character do what she appeared to be doing to the other character once they reached their goal, and if so, is our hero running because he fears the worst or because he was in on the plot? Or can it be so simple that he has been alerted of the salvation that awaits?<br/><br/>Triangle of Sadness is outstanding. My only complaints are minor, including a few character moments that don't make sense -- and can't really be explained away by in-text stupidity -- as well as exactly one CGI donkey that doesn't look great. Still, this is the best time I've had in a movie theater in a long time, as is so often the case when the attendees are offered puke bags and at least one viewer is forced to leave the auditorium for some air.<br/><br/>At the screening I attended (and likely all other screenings in my country), the film was preceded by a short snippet of Östlund showing off the Palme D'Or he received at Cannes in May, where he also garnered a standing ovation of eight minutes. Normally, I'd find that sort of thing a tad pretentious, but Östlund seems like a genuine man and, Hell, when it's a filmmaker from my country, I can't help but develop a sports-team mentality of sorts. Suck on that, Denmark. (I kid, I thought the Riget: Exodus was also really good.)</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">This mess is a result of being on a bad acid trip when writing the screenplay, then drunker than Woody Harrelson's (the only reason I gave this a watch) character when directing. All the high praise and positive reviews are probably the result of those viewers being under the same influence of bad recreational pharmaceuticals and cheap liquor.<br/><br/>Writer, director and editor (was this mess even edited ?) Ruben Ostlund has no clue on satirical delivery, nor how to tell a story. This film needs to be an example in film school on what not to do. The ridiculously long and poorly paced 2-1/2 hour runtime was about 2 hours too long. This felt more like a last minute bad SNL sketch dragged out to eternity.<br/><br/>Ostlund tried to create something deep and smart but in reality, it is an arrogant display of cartoonish, lazy, basic hollow writing. There's a huge lack of follow-through. Satires should at least make you laugh - this one maybe one chuckle in 147 mins of torture. His use of chapters was bloated, skewered, skattershotly uneven and superficial nonsense, with about 20 minutes of ridiculous verbal diarrhea masking itself as social commentary being spewed out over a ship's intercom. This film is neither as smart nor as interesting as it clearly thinks it is.<br/><br/>This is the worst directed and written film I've seen in a long time. If you want to get even at someone, have them watch this mess telling them to be patient until the end for the big welcoming and worth-the-wait reveal. You'll never hear from them again. It's a very generous 3/10 from me, all for the casting and performances considering what they had to work with, and the cool We've Lost Dancing ending song.</div>\n",

There's very silly parts which simply don't make sense. There's other parts I can't remember because my mind tuned out of it frequently as it was so boring and annoying.

Lots of character development, seemingly endless possibilities, then it started to drop like a rock from a skyscraper!<br/><br/>From there it got extremely unrealistic, there was no explanation for the mass puke and poop fest, and seemed like it was a food issue rather than a turbulent ocean issue, but they seemed to focus on the latter! Hard to follow.<br/><br/>Woody Haralson is in this, but as per usual, he's weird quirky and really adds so little to the movie!<br/><br/>Now we are in the final phase of this movie, the last third...this is when it just falls apart completely. The movie is fractured, the writing is lazy, the story is just dumb and impossible to follow.<br/><br/>The last five minutes are a total waste of time and close the loop on this colossal waste of time of a movie!<br/><br/>If you have not watched it and are reading reviews to make a determination, do yourself a massive favor and totally ignore the high review rating, filter to see the lower reviews... I promise you they are the only real ones!<br/><br/>Even the 4 star reviews are a bit questionable.</div>\n",

It's starts off great with the scene of the male models being interviewed and then young couples dialog over who pays for the dinner at the restaurant and then the story jumped to the story of the passengers on the yacht with Woody as their captain. But after they are shipwrecked (no spoilers on the how and why) the story takes a serious nose dive and starts falling completely apart in the process. The build up to the ending scene was totally nonsensical and you realize that the trailer has the best parts for entire film. A underwhelmingly recommended one time watch. Heads up.... Woody Harrelson's role is short and brief.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Ten days after its opening here in Denmark, this movie is still playing to packed theatres, so apparently many people like it. It also has a pretty high rating, but I fear it will go down.<br/><br/>I am an anti-capitalist myself, so I appreciated what this movie was trying to do, which is to use ham-fisted symbolism to problematize and criticize capitalism. There were some good scenes, mainly during the captain's dinner scene, but unfortunately I just don't think Östlund is much of an accomplished writer or director. Throughout this movie I was bored - esp. By the slowness, which is really unforgivable. Very little really happened in this movie in terms of plot, and it took forever to get to the meatier parts. For a comedy, it also wasn't much fun. 2-3 laughs, tops. Comic timing wasn't good. The political message of the movie was also so heavy-handed that it can hardly be called art; it's more of a didactic tract. At 2 hours and 30 minutes, the movie is far, far, faaar too long - an entire hour could easily be cut.<br/><br/>The length is a particular sin because of the movie's infuriatingly terrible ending, which is sudden and nonsensical, making the audience feel like we've only gotten half of the story. That ending, which cut off the plot, leaving it unresolved, cost this movie a whole star in my rating. Endings are hard, granted - but this is the ending of a writer/director who really doesn't know how to structure a story. As a result, the movie only gets a slightly above average rating - 6 stars out of 10 - from me. A disappointment.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I really like the Square so I was expecting Triangle of Sadness to be similarly brilliant take on wealth. Didn't quite get what I expected.<br/><br/>Triangle of Sadness never really finds its own voice as it first introduces a lot of oblivious characters, who all come across as thin stereotypes we have seen many times over in countless movies, and then puts them into situations that are what you'd expect them to get into. There is the dumb and jealous male model and his flirtatious girlfriend. There is the rich and loud Russian. There is the drunk captain. There is the prim head of ship staff. There is the lovely British couple who got rich selling grenades.<br/><br/>Making matters worse, there isn't much plot which Director Östlund tries to make up by stretching each scene to extreme lengths. The epitome of this approach is the seasickness interlude that had everyone throwing up for over 10 minute. None of it matters, just like the characters don't matter.<br/><br/>After what feels like an eternity, the story drifts to a dead end that is lifted straight from an old Amanda Bynes comedy. At least that poor teenage vehicle knew how to tie its own loose ends whereas Östlund abruptly abandons his characters as if having got enough of everyone.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">\"Triangle of Sadness\" (2022 release. 148 min.) opens with \"Part 1 Carl &amp; Yaya\", introducing us to the couple: Carl is a male model, and Yaya is a social media influencer (making more money than Carl). They end up having a major argument over who is to pay for dinner at a restaurant. As we get to \"Part 2: The Yacht\", Yaya is invited to a luxury cruise for free, bringing along Carl... To tell you more of the plot would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the latest from Swedish writer-producer-director Ruben Östlund (\"Force Majeure\", \"The Square\"). Here he brings another slice of black comedy-drama that is perfectly in line with his prior output, and perhaps his best work yet. The movie offers a biting commentary on society's power structure. Once again, Östlund brings this in a particular visual style, making plenty of use of extra long takes where the camera simply stands and observes what is happening. The cast is outstanding all around, including Harris Dickinson (as Carl ) and Charlbi Dean (as Yaya). If you are not aware, Charlbi Dean died last August after a quick illness. What a tragedy. She was only 32. \"Triangle of Sadness\" premiered at last year's Cannes Film Festival, where it promptly won the top prize (Palm d'Or). The film received 3 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay.<br/><br/>\"Triangle of Sadness\" was released in US theaters last October and even though I really wanted to see it, it didn't stick around very long in theaters and hence I missed it. Thankfully it started streaming on Hulu, which is where I caught it last night. If you are in the mood for a top notch dark comedy-drama, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The good news. Woody harrelson is only in one third of the film. The odd news. Seventy percent of the reviewers give this movie an 8 or higher. The bad news. This thing stinks. A millennial argues over who should pay the check and why. They they get on a yacht and continue to argue. The young man is especially annoying. Just how spoiled can you get. Then we meet some of the paying guests on the yacht. Arms dealers, marxists, commies, etc. The theme of the crew-keep the passengers happy. Yes to everything. No matter how stupid the request or question. (remember we're supposed to be laughing during all this). Rough seas dampen dinner with the drunken captain and the hilarity starts. If watching people throw up and get tossed around the ship is your cup of tea, this part is for you. There's more going on, but trust me, its not pleasant. Then a drunken passenger takes over the pa system and announces the ship is going down and then explains that its a joke. Watching a husband get his stricken wife into a wheel chair is a laugh riot. Ha, ha. We don't see what happens next. Hijackers take over the ship and in fact it does sink. Then we get into a little of lord of the flies and maybe gilligan's island. There's comeuppance for those who don't get it? (are movie audiences dumber now because of covid and watching tv for two years)? Apparently the film maker thinks so.. the trailer gave me pause. I should have listened to my little voice. Stinker, stinker. Or maybe it was sinker.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">If you loved Dil Chahta Hain, there's no way you'd not like 'Rock ON'. I have just returned from a small screening of the movie last night and it was 'Fantabulous'. I had been waiting for it since long and the wait was worth it. If you think that the movie is all about Rock and being cool, its not. It's about desiring something and breaking all the rules to get there.<br/><br/>I don't want to speak out the story here as it is among the best written screenplays I have seen in any movie so far  be it Indian Cinema or Hollywood. The flashbacks and the montages and the cuts were brilliantly placed. There are a few things that I'd specifically ask you to watch out for. First is Jason West's cinematography; absolutely commendable. Then there is the music and sound design which is powerful yet sweet and the star attribute of the movie  the performances. They are flawless, Farhan is good, Prachi is amazing, Suhana is complete and Arjun Rampal has delivered the best performance of his life (watch out for the climax).<br/><br/>The live performances in the movie were well done, Magic could have been more aggressive but they had good presence. 'Shair n Func', came and went and their song was pretty catchy. Chakravhyu was super sexy",
      "and sheer evil and none the least RADIO were rocking as usual with 'Musafir'  beautiful song that one.<br/><br/>In the end Rock On is a really sweet movie and a must watch for the people, both young and old, who dare to dream and are willing to walk that road in order to achieve it. I absolutely loved the movie and am definitely going for it again. Indian Rock Bands rule!!!!!!!</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">\"Rock On!!\" is an Indian film about a group of guys who made up a rock/pop band a decade ago. The film begins in the present day and the lead singer of this group, Magik, is now a very successful businessman. He's so wrapped up in his job that he pushes his wife out of his life. She doesn't even know about this past life--and only stumbles upon his being in a band by accident. However, when she does, she contacts his other band mates and tries to get them back together. But Aditya isn't grateful--instead he treats his old friends like they are a part of the past he'd like to keep in the past. Can Aditya come around and finally open up his heart to these guys? And, he's not the only one with problems. Joe loves music and never left the music business...but his wife is a serious detriment and seems bent on squashing his dream. And then there is one other member with a serious problem...one you only learn about late in the film. Can all these problems be worked out so that Magik can once again find the magic?<br/><br/>This film is different from a typical Bollywood film because it's clearly targeted towards a younger and hipper sort of audience. This isn't a complaint---just an observation. I really like the style in which the story was told and the story is enjoyable. The only negatives I noticed are that the story seemed a bit predictable and only offered one big surprise. The other wasn't the fault of the original production but the DVD had serious issues. Instead of playing properly, often the film would play a portion and when it came to the next segment, it would bounce back to the scene menu! This is very odd and I've never had it happen before.<br/><br/>By the way, if you do watch the film, watch Joe when he plays guitar. Every time he does, a hidden wind machine catches his hair and it's actually unintentionally funny.</div>\n",

However, they don't matter anymore.<br/><br/>As the title aptly suggests, this movie ROCKS! y far one the most different, entertaining and wonderfully surprising films of recent times. Rock On meets, surpasses and blows the expectations of the viewer out of the window. Brilliant.<br/><br/>This movie is one of those rare ones that actually focuses just on the music. It doesn't move of into some romantic tune or dramatic effect. It stays true to it's heart and soul. The Music.<br/><br/>All the actors perform brilliantly with a special mention to Arjun Rampal and Prachi Desai who shines out in her debut film. But best of all is the showstopper. Farhan Akhtar. <br/><br/>This man is a genius! He can sing (only rock!) act and direct (not this one though). Brilliant. By far the shining star of this move. He carries his role out with exceptional ease and actually seems as good as any seasoned actor of a high caliber. Hats off.<br/><br/>In the end, this movie is what it is: <br/><br/>\" Brilliant as it is, the message is heard as if in stock, this movieends in bliss, but only after making you ROCK!\"<br/><br/>Superb! Watch it and ROCK ON !!!!!</div>\n",

Somethings go awry and the friends who shared the same passion drift away, each leading their own life.<br/><br/>A decade later, some circumstances bring these four friends together and Magik is in action again to give the most memorable performance ever.The story of course has more to it but you rather watch the movie to learn that.<br/><br/>Director Abhishek Kapoor has captured the fragility of relationships on the celluloid with compelling ease. Farhan Akhtar has emerged as an actor and as a super singer, with no signs of débutant syndrome to be seen in his performance. Arjun Rampal surprises with one of his finest performances till date. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy;s music just rocks.<br/><br/>The movie Rock On has the blended concoction of some outstanding performances, engulfing emotions and topping it is the execution of the entire theme. I have a gut of the film Rock On is going to rock the box-office as well.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Sure, sure. There has been numerous attempts at adapting the greatest music genre of all time into the Hindi arena; at getting rock music to blend in with Indian songs. But while some attempts were partly successful, most of them were as ridiculous as dressing up an elephant in a ballerina costume and expecting a successful ballet.<br/><br/>While some original Indian songs (yes, there ARE original un-plagiarized Hindi songs...) have had their own charm about it, it seemed completely alien to the tone and touch that embodies rock. But this movie brings with it some of the first successful merges between the two giant. The ballerina costume doesn't look out of place at all",
      " ;) Since I've started out with the songs, let me get a few things clarified first. The lyrics are",
      " eclectic. Sporadic, random",
      " yet not gibberish. It could have been better, but it's NOT bad at all per se. But the music, and Farhan Akhtar's voice and compelling screen presence all build the songs to a well deserve hype.<br/><br/>Performances were amazing. No ham acting, no glitzy deviations, no bullshit",
      " It was a honest and down to earth approach, and I, for one, applaud the trend in Bollywood. The plot was simple enough - for a while, it felt like the sequel to 'That Thing You Do' - and it was delivered very powerfully. I have to make a special mention about the cinematography. It was awesome. It used the restricted depth of field approach in several shots, and yet did not give a feeling that it was overused.<br/><br/>At this point, I should probably mention something about me. The last Hindi movie I really liked was Taare Zameen Par",
      " the one before that was Dil Chahta Hai, and the one before that was probably Mr. India. So you should understand that I am typically not generous with praises for Bollywood. So when I say Rock On rocked on, it means something",
      ".<br/><br/>Now's the time to nitpick. And here on, there's gonna be some spoilers. This basically means that if you HAVEN'T watched the movie yet, you should probably throw a rock at the monitor, cover your eyes, and jump behind the couch over there so that you get to enjoy the movie properly when you DO see it. Alternatively, you can use this time to actually go get the tickets and hop in a theater seat with popcorn. When you return, you'll be well equipped to read the rest of this article.<br/><br/>The plot was smooth, except for a few things that detracted my attention. Firstly, the big fight  What was that all about? For guys who are all that pally with each other, the situation had NOT developed into such a state as to demand a ten year hiatus. They took a guy fight",
      " and treated it like a darned girl fight.<br/><br/>You know what I mean",
      " Except for certain really extreme lines getting crossed (such as stealing each other's make up",
      " or not) guys get over such fights after two days and a mug of beer. And while I can understand that Farhan Akhtar has a short temper, it's still a far stretch to imagine that when one of his closest friends hit him, he just packs up and leaves music and starts over a new life...?? The build up to the fight kept implying that it was something huge... We were dropped hints of Farhan betraying friends, great ego clashes building up, and something mysterious that was so sinister that everything turned topsy turvy after the fight. And the fight actually didn't give anything on that scale. OK, things were turning sour, Farhan was starting to build an ego, sure.. but it was just starting... I expected something AT LEAST as heated as the band split in 'That Thing You Do'.... The lead singer was ACTUALLY building an ego.... starting to feel he carried the entire weight of the band, and that the rest didn't really matter, etc etc... Nothing like that happened here. It seemed so out of character, so out of place.<br/><br/>But... remember what I said.. These are just nitpicks... Even with this bump on the road, the movie was nothing short of brilliant.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I had been waiting to see this movie ever since the promos and trailers hit the theaters. This is the first proper Indian rock band movie, and with a compelling star cast this was bound to be a joy to watch. And I was not disappointed. It was 140 minutes of pure fun. This is finally a movie where we don't have any catchy item numbers or some stupid unwanted songs. Its a movie about a rock band, so we have rock songs. Songs with guitar riffs, drum solos, and kick-ass vocals.<br/><br/>The story is quite simple. 4 college buddies dream big, they dream high. They want to form a band and become the next big thing in the upcoming rock culture. They do all that, against all odds, going against their careers their parents chose for them. But somewhere along the line, we have ego clashes amongst the band members, which results in the band breaking up, even before they released their first album. Years later, things have changed. But they make a last gasp reunion, and leave the stage on a high.<br/><br/>Whilst the story is critical, for any movie, its not something which is flashy. Its your regular story, one which you can expect out of a Bollywood movie. But the presentation makes the difference. Coupled with some wonderful songs and a brilliant background score, and some superb acting, Rock On! gives you a startlingly different flavor from the regular Bollywood masala movies. The acting has been overall brilliant, there were some patches were it was becoming evident that most of them are newbies in front of the camera, but we can bother to overlook that small mistake. Farhan Akhtar debut performance as the lead singer, Adi, the successful investment banker, the one with the flamboyant vocals, gives a brilliant performance. He is the protagonist of the story, and he controls the tempo of the movie.Add to that he has sung most of the songs himself.<br/><br/>Arjun Rampal, as the lead guitarist, Joseph \"Joe\" Mascarenhas is another complicated character. He is another central character to the story and he gives the movie far more credibility. He's this brilliant guitarist, who has rock in his blood. But he's financially insecure, and this results in his poor family background, his family's fishing business. He has a great sense of pride in his musical talent and like the forefathers of rock, he refuses to sell his pride. He refuses to play in pubs and clubs, and insists on playing for his own happiness rather than for cash, in spite of his family troubles.<br/><br/>KD,\"Killer Drummer\", he's the heart of the band. Purab Kohli, makes it a point to play the drums, and make an honest effort to look credible enough. He's the wacko junkie, with the weirdest possible fashion sense, like wearing a tie over a tee shirt to every gig. Like all others after the Magik era he's wasting away in his family business.<br/><br/>Last and definitely not the least Luke Kenny as Rob. He was the manager/keyboardist of the band. He organized gigs for them, and he was the one who became successful musically, recording with Anu Malik on small time jobs. And he was the one who brings the band together after 10 years, amidst tragedies.<br/><br/>Special mention must be made of Prachi Desai and Sahana Goswami. Both have been brilliant at the roles they have reprised. Prachi as Sakshi, the wife of Adi, and Sahana as Debbie, Joe's wife gives a superb performance. Especially Sahana, she did a brilliant brilliant job, portraying two very different characters in the two eras. The acting, the music, the camera work, has all been superb, excellent. Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy bring forth their magic as the amazing music directors, so does Javed Akhtar with the catchy lyrics.<br/><br/>One negative aspect may be, that this movie is somewhat shortened. We could have explored certain characters more, but the makers probably thought to leave this at that, and not make the movie a bit more predictable. For example, Dalip Tahil as Adi's boss has basically just 2 scenes. And Nicollete Bird as the old flame of Adi is almost an extra. Those 2 characters could have been explored a bit. I'm sure there will be long deleted scenes in the DVD.<br/><br/>Apart from the brilliant music, the acting, and the character portrayal, the movie also follows a important message. To always follow your dreams and your heart. We see that with Joe, a financially insecure person, who leaves behind a job where hes guaranteed a large sum of money to play with his old band, to ignite his flame, his passion for playing on stage in a proper rock gig. We see Rob, who's dieing away slowly, to overcome all odds and play with his old buddies for one last time, on stage. And lastly KD, in his last lines, \"I don't care what you fellows think. But I've been among your personal ego clashes for a long time, and I'm going out there on stage even if I have to drum all alone for 20 minutes, I'll do it.\" This movie might not appeal to the older audience who might shun this as a youth film. Yes, this movie is based on today's youth, but it carries a message which is universally applicable. It uses the rock culture to promote this meaning, this message. Kudos to Farhan Akhtar again for treating us to another delight. 10/10.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Four friends share a common passion for music and form a rock band called Magik. Aditya (Farhan Akhtar) is the lead vocalist, Joe (Arjun Rampal) is the guitarist, KD (Purab Kohli) is the drummer and Rob (Luke Kenny) handles the keyboard. They get a chance to cut out an album but things don't work out and the group splits to go their separate ways.<br/><br/>A decade later Aditya's wife Sakshi (Prachi Desai) attempts to reunite the group. After some initial hiccups and ego clashes, the band members bond and blend to brew good tunes. Predictably the climax is set in a rock concert where the band performs to perfection.<br/><br/>Despite such patented predictability, one still relates to Rock On. You noticeably know that Arjun Rampal would make a late entry in the climax concert but your heart still goes out on his appearance. You aren't surprised when one of the band members is diagnosed of cancer but you still feel for him. That's because the simplicity and sincerity of the direction and performances touch you.<br/><br/>The storytelling is somewhat slow and drags in the preliminary portions. The film gets into frequent flashback episodes and at times you are caught unaware on the instance where it ends. Even the back-story takes a tad bit long to reach to the point where the band disperses. Unimaginatively the screenplay uses the same scheme of a rock concert for its first key plot-point and also the climax. But seemingly that was inevitable since the genre of the film restricts its creative scope. Also Farhan Akhtar's breakup with his girlfriend doesn't come across quite convincingly.<br/><br/>On the upside, the musical theme of the film is ably supported by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy's rocking score. For once you don't feel that songs are forced in a Bollywood film. There's also a splendid spoof on how the band merges rock with dandiya to gain some quick money. How one wishes the film had more of such lighter moments which would have accentuated the youthful appeal to Dil Chahta Hai extents. The director also manages to pull off a subtle satire on Anu Malik, while casting him at his own expense.<br/><br/>Rock On seems to be clearly designed by Farhan Akhar as his own acting debut and he doesn't let himself down. Lending voice to all his songs helps him to get into his character with effortless ease. One could certainly overlook the lisp in his dialogue delivery. Arjun Rampal looks mature in his character but isn't quite credible while handling the guitar. Purab Kohli has a natural flair for comedy and Luke Kenny is persuasive in his role. From the female leads Shahana Goswami as Arjun's wife comes up with the most compelling act and adds some depth to the drama. Prachi Desai justifies her poised presence.<br/><br/>It's interesting how director Abhishek Kapoor attempts to make commercial entertainers on subjects that are not much prevalent in our country. His last film Aryan was on boxing, a sport not much popular in India and now he tries his hands on rock culture, which again isn't much recognized here. At least this time he succeeds in creating a realistic rock feel.<br/><br/>Rock On strikes a chord on that note.</div>\n",

Then, came the reviews and they were surprisingly positive which raised my expectation bar. And after watching the movie, I realized that both (moive and the reviews) were Spot On!! Abhishek Kapoor's 'Rock On!!' is indeed a rocking and a refreshing film.<br/><br/>It tells the story about four young friends who put together a wonderful band called 'Magik' but could never make it big. The movie brilliantly depicts the life of aspiring rock stars in India and carefully handles their rise, fall and reunion. The whole movie see-saws between the past and the present which keeps the viewer interested.<br/><br/>Acting is also nice. Frahan Akhtar acts well and is a capable singer. Though I hope he doesn't become Himesh #2 and keeps his singing within limits. Rest of the cast- Arjun, Purab, Luke, Prachi and Sahana also do well.<br/><br/>As for the negatives, the movie was a little lengthy. Plus, I believe the incident with \"Rob\" was unnecessary which didn't suit the general \"feel-good\" mood of the film.<br/><br/>Despite some shortcomings, Rock on!! is indeed a noteworthy attempt and needs to be applauded. Well done.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The way some goals are so worthy that it's glorious even to fail, the same way some dreams are so lovely that even when they are not turning into reality, we should live them and allow them to live in us. And to the extent possible, we should pursue our dreams which are positive for us and negative for none. That's what is the message of Rock On (2008).<br/><br/>Rock On tells the story of four friends who had dreamed to make it big in the world of music when in their early twenties - 1. Aaditya Shroff aka Aadi (Farhaan Akhtar), 2. Joseph Mascarenhaas aka Joe (Arjun Raampaal), 3. Kedar Zhaveri aka Killer Drummer aka KD (Poorab Kohli), 4. Robert Nancy aka Rob (Luke Kenny). They participated in a contest whose prize an opportunity to make own music album. These foursome known as Magic won the contest and then set to get own music album recorded. But the so-called practical world is populated less by the innocent dreamers like them and more by the manipulators who occupy chairs of power and authority to dictate terms to them despite not having an ounce of worthiness for that. And the truly deserving, talented ones have to listen to them and follow their dictates because the moment of time is on their side. These youngsters also had to endure everything and swallow all the bitter pills thrown at them by the chair-holders who controlled the resources. Aadi being more practical and adjusting digested everything so that the way towards the arrival of their first ever music album is paved. However Joe being a short-tempered man of self-respect fell prey to the irritating situation, leading to end of everything for these dreamers including their association.<br/><br/>A decade has passed. Now these four friends are no longer a foursome. Each one of them is leading or struggling in his individual life. Aadi and KD are leading their lives which are comfortable though not internally satisfying whereas Joe and Rob are still struggling in the lines chosen or forced on them to make both ends meet. Aadi is a successful investment banker and happily married with Saakshi (Praachi Desaai) who feels that her husband has been hiding something as high and heavy as a mountain in his heart, not allowing herself to see it. He attempts to appear as happy but his inner reality is something else. She does not know that her husband is carrying the burden of a broken dream within him. KD is associated with his father's jewellery business being out of alternatives for himself. Rob is still struggling in the world of music and keeps in touch with Bollywood composer - Anu Malik. The most pathetic situation is that of Joe who has been fortunate enough to marry the love of his life - Debbie (Shahaana Goswami) but the struggle to make both ends meet for the family moves from day to day. Joe who wanted to be a great violinist is forced to sing here and there to get some money whereas Debbie who had dreamed with Joe to become a fashion-designer is taking care of the small scale fish business of his family which is the only main source of income for them.<br/><br/>Fate makes KD meet Saakshi and then Saakshi comes to know of the bygone era containing the shattered dreams of the foursome. She tries to bring the separated friends together again and her success in this regard not only rekindle the hopes of the friends to do something worthwhile in the world of music but also bridges the decade old rift between Aadi and Joe. Debbie, being too much concerned with the poverty-stricken condition of their household arranges an overseas job for Joe but destiny has other plans. The magic band is revived but when it is about to take the stage for the second opportunity given to it by fate, Joe has to board the ship and Rob has to face death (because he has been suffering from a fatal illness for long). The climax takes place on a highly emotional note and when the movie is over, the viewer feels a throbbing in his / her heart.<br/><br/>Rock On is a movie with its heart in the right place. It's a movie with a soul. Despite certain flaws here and there and the fact that the musical score of a movie based on a rock band should have been far superior to that of this movie, let me say loud and clear that Rock On is a superb movie. Very few mainstream movies are made in India with this level of sincerity. It's a movie of dreams. It's a movie of relationships. It's a movie of determination. It's a movie of survival in the cruel world.<br/><br/>The style of narration is simply mindblowing. Cutting the narrative back and forth in the past as well as the present without even a drop of confusion, deserves lots of applause. <br/><br/>All the principal actors have done superbly. I choose Shahaana Goswami as the best performer and Arjun Raampaal after her. But others are no less. Even supporting ones like Koel Purie (Saakshi's friend whom KD falls for) and Nicollette Bird (the ex-girlfriend of Aadi) have done complete justice to their roles.<br/><br/>Rock On is a must watch for every dreamer. Fulfillment of dreams depends on certain external factors too and everybody is not fortunate to have his / her dream fulfilled. However our dreams are our babies. Let's not abandon them. Even when unfulfilled, they have given us a lot and hence they deserve to be cherished in our hearts. And if still there is a scope to make our dreams to be turned into reality, let's believe that it can be done.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Ode to Dil Chahta Hain:: <br/><br/>√ Farhan Akhtar plays an extended version of Akash.<br/><br/>√ Arjun Rampal reprises Sid.<br/><br/>√ Turn Dimple Kapadia into a male character and add them into a trio  voila, you have DCH of four! <br/><br/>√ The misunderstanding/ breakup.<br/><br/>√ The final moments before the credits rolls.<br/><br/>√ The past narrated in flashback.<br/><br/>Well, one should appreciate the makers were honest to admit publicly that the movie was DCH Part Deux.<br/><br/>Performances:: <br/><br/>√ Farhan Akhtar:: He doesn't falter a bit and delivers an eye-opener performance in terms of the subtle nuances and body language he bring in. Of course, his distinct voice is his his greatest asset. Hindsight, he should have done \"Lucky\" in Main Hoon Na, at least the role would have been more memorable.<br/><br/>√ Arjun Rampal:: Probably first time one would take notice of his performance as it is very matured and restrained. Lets hope it does what DCH did to Akshaye Khanna.<br/><br/>√ Purab Kohli, Luke Kenny &amp; Shahana Goswami:: Should capitalise on the success of the movie to get a strong foothold in Bollywood. Good performances otherwise.<br/><br/>√ Prachi Desai is good in her \"Miss Goody Two Shoes\" role. BTW  why was her character a bit pushy towards male bonding? <br/><br/>√ Koel Purie is as usual OK.<br/><br/>Too many flashbacks hinder the narrative. Should have been confined to a single one.<br/><br/>The songs would take sometime to catch on as they belong to Rock genre and not the usual run-out-of mill.<br/><br/>The protagonists passion for music give you a feel of Jhankaar Beats and so does the climax.<br/><br/>The movie is handled extremely well on all technical fronts. A very well made movie. Looking forward your next outing Gattu Kapoor! <br/><br/>PS: Javed Saab, does the usage of \"Darling\" refer to a previous experience of your in the Bollywood?</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Rock is all about employing electric and bass guitars, thundering drums with a mix of organ or piano or synthesizers giving you all a severe head-banging session. Well, that's what rock means to me and Rock On! is a great attempt bringing the same feel to 70MM! Rock On! is an ideal example of bridging cult with mainline Hindi cinema. Kudos! <br/><br/>The movie is about how 4 talented friends with same passion for music creates a band called Magik and wanted to become 'somebody' in music industry. The movie focuses on how they stay together, achieve what they want to, broke up with each other and re-unites one last time. Director has done a marvelous job in bringing all characters alive. He didn't allow more characters floating all around and coming in between. He simply focuses on Magik and their select close ones.<br/><br/>Soul of this movie lies in its music. The music of Rock On! is packed with extremely catchy kick ass numbers. Though all the numbers are rocking but my top three favorites are 'Zehreelay' 'Pichhle Saat Dinon' and 'Ye Tumhari Meri Baatein'. 'Zehreelay' is the heaviest soundtrack of any Indian movie so far. It's wild, full of energy and extremely noisy. Lyrics are weird and the interesting part is the vocal. You can do extreme screaming when you sing in English but when it comes to Hindi, it's a different ball game. It is tough to sing so loud and extreme that too with perfect vocals in Hindi. Simply hell yeah! 'Pichhle saat dinon' is a song that grows on you and later, you can't live without. The song is so popular that they have made a spl video for it. 'Ye Tumhari Meri Baatein' is beautiful song with a tinge of jazz to it. It will make you feel as if it is made for you and your love. Another wonderful track is 'Socha hai'. It's like back to roots, real rock song where lyrics come out from no where. Title soundtrack 'Rock On!', 'Sindbad the sailor' and 'Fir Dekhiye' are simply outstanding. Another special song is a slow rock ballad 'Tum ho to'. In age of one song wonder soundtracks Rock On! is a surprise package. Each and every song is a chart buster. In fact, I'm now so used to listening Rock On! songs where ever I roam! Office, Pubs, Music stores and channels, Radio its every where! It's like rock music in its purest form with a strong, insistent back beat, and a catchy melody! <br/><br/>The movie is well crafted but the plot is not something new. It's a predictable movie and you know exactly what will happen next. Also, dialogs don't have that punch like the songs and its theme. I like Farhan Akhtar as a director, singer, and actor but excluding his voice. I do not know why but some how he is not that great when he talks.<br/><br/>There are so many well crafted scenes that had lit up this movie. My favorite scene is where Magik performs at a local society to raise money. I will not reveal much of it but I just couldn't stop laughing like mad while watching it. Also, the scene where Magik performs at a music contest then fights with each other and split. Its sheer delight as director sketched those scenes brilliantly.<br/><br/>Rock On! truly justifies its title with some heavy dope of rocking music and acting. More important, it's the simplicity of the movie which will make you happy while coming out of the movie screen with a message to all- know matter what may come... keep rocking!</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">First of all, I have to tell you that Farhan Akhtar is a ROCKSTAR !!! Man what films he has made till date - DCH, Lakshya and now this one. Along with Farhan, Abhishek Kapoor(whose first film Arryan didn't do too well) too has done a great job as a director. Though I could make out a few goofs, but considering the fact that I was so engrossed in the movie, they can be overlooked.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is excellent. Arjum Rampal for a change is so much better than his earlier performances. But, I still feel he could have done better. Prachi Desai gives a SMASHING performance. So much depth in her character and boy-o-boy, did she play it well. Purab was such a refreshing element throughout. He's completely lovable.<br/><br/>Now, for the music. I'm so proud to hear the first mainstream Rock album of India. And I'm glad they have not messed up the songs and have kept the raw, college boy feel to all the songs. Even the slow tracks(2 of them) are so soothing. Brilliant album. Kudos to Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy.<br/><br/>Finally, Rock On is really fresh film, if not a classic. Technically its not 10/10 but just for the EQ(emotional quotient) I give it a 10.But, for lovers of mature drama and emotions, it'll be a treat. Thank you Farhan, Abhishek etc. etc. for such a refreshing change. Best Indian film of 2008 till now, hands down !!!!</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">The basic idea of the movie is just as 'Dil Chahta Hai'- a fight between two friends and their reunion(But here there's' much more after the that). Let me clear first: THE SONGS ARE AWESOME 10/10.<br/><br/>Very nicely directed, the film has slow pace in the first half and the story may confuse some, as there are a lot of flashbacks. some unwanted characters too included. But the second half has the perfect speed and will cling you to the seats. the whole idea of ROCK ON!! gets concentrated here, no stupid incidences, no unwanted scenes-perfect The only thing which i didn't like was the reunion of MAGIK (not as great as it should be- could be much grand) Talking about performances- everyone does a great Job, special mention for Luke Kenny and Purab Kohli. Prachi Desai (cant say a newcomer, been in daily soaps) looks lovely, acts well. Farhan has surely some thing for Singing. The songs sound genuine as are sung by Farhan than some professional singer. Lots of light moments throughout the film, wonderfully shot. The end is wonderful.... you will probably guess the end, but it will turn out much greater.<br/><br/>For hardcore ROCK fans, don't expect NIRVANA, GREENDAY, or DEEP PURLPE, its bollywood ROCK<br/><br/>You will surely come out of the theatre with smiles- thats for sure.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Farhan Akhtar has done it again! Rock On is an excellent movie and one that I would definitely would not mind watching again, in fact I am definitely going to go again. Just like how Dil Chahta Hai started a new movement in Indian cinema, I am sure that now, more projects of the same type will start coming out of the woodwork. I just hope that they can measure upto the quality of Rock On.<br/><br/>The casting was good and the ensemble cast gave great performances. Purab kohli, Luke and Arjun Rampal were all good although Arjun Rampal was still a bit stiff with the guitar in hand. On the other hand Farhan looked like an absolute natural playing the guitar, he had excellent stage presence as the lead singer. As for the heroines, Suhana and Prachi were good although I quite liked the former, she has striking looks and has pretty good acting chops. Hope to see more of her in the future.<br/><br/>Farhan Akhtar was excellent, in my opinion he has given a subtle but pitch perfect performance that was very natural. It should put several veterans of the big screen to shame......I won't name any names but just imagine some of our existing Bollywood heroes hamming it up on stage and compare them with the Farhan performance.<br/><br/>The music was excellent. How good does it feel to look at an actor actually singing his own songs........so much more real and I am sure that it helped Farhan to take his performance to new heights. Akhtar's singing wasn't perfect but it had the raw quality which went well with the overall feel and theme of the movie. SEL &amp; javed Akhtar also deserve their plaudits. I don't see why people were complaining about the music.<br/><br/>Abhishek the director has to be given a lot of credit for the final product, which although has a lot of clichés still manages to hold our attention and makes us root for his characters. Well done.....hope he will not come up with a damp squib after this.<br/><br/>Farhan Akhtar has become one of the few film personalities in Indian cinema whose name has become synonymous with high quality films. When I see Farhan Akhtar's name attached to a product either as a director or a producer then I would definitely make the time to see the film as I would in the case of Hollywood names such as Steven Spielberg or a Denzel Washington. Fine, he is not in the same league yet but now that Farhan has added the acting feather to his cap we can expect high quality output from him as an actor as well as as a director and a producer.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">For the most part, \"Rock On!!\", though engagingly realistic and well-acted, is not a particularly rocking movie. Considering it's about a rock band, the film is fairly slow and at times even tedious. There is some depressing feel to it although the viewer may clearly feel the light in the end of a tunnel will certainly come at some point. What I really liked about this film, however, is the portrayal of relationships. I think it was very well done, and it was the film's best-depicted aspect. It was actually the main aspect which pushed the otherwise unmovable narrative forward. The film's concept is interesting, but not really new or unused. It's neither intriguing nor unpredictable.<br/><br/>The performances are good in this order: Shahana Goswami is mind-blowing as Debbie. She is an excellent actress with a very natural and intense style and a particularly forceful dialogue delivery. This clearly is the best performance of the film. Arjun Rampal's is the best performance among the male cast, and he is thoroughly convincing in a role that is essentially a very passive one. Prachi Desai acts very well and she is vulnerable and convincing throughout the film. Farhan Akhtar makes a good debut, nothing outstanding though. He is a bit wooden in some scenes, but otherwise okay, and he actually sings very well. Purab Kohli is effective but does not really get that much of a scope.<br/><br/>\"Rock On!!\" is a one-time watch for me. It has its moments, it has good acting, the music is excellent, but the story is not very well executed. I felt there was much more to show and much more to tell about the rock band. It is done quite realistically and does not go over the top, but it has its share of clichés, unreasonable coincidences and ancient emotions, which neither move nor impress. Nevertheless, I liked the rather positive ending, which in spite of its predictability was quite efficient. The final verdict is above average according to me. I expected something else, but it's just me, watch it and make your own conclusions.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">You may not feel the way you felt after watching \"Dil Chahta Hai\" but you are sure to feel good and contented to have something new on the Indian Celluloid. \"Rock On\" may not be a trend setter but it will surely act as a path opener for the budding film-makers.<br/><br/>Rock mania or Rock style of living have very limited takers in our part of the world. And that might be the reason the director doesn't follow the hardcore rock styles but opts for a soft rock feel in the movie. But he does a fine and competent job, shifting from his acting to directing a movie he believed in. Abhishek Kapoor comes up with a movie which has a fresh appeal, a perfect script with perfect character sketches which are capable to hold even the viewers who don't know what \"Rock\" is. It's about four friends and their rock band called \"Magik\", their struggle to make it big, their break up and then their re-union after a gap of 10 years. Apart from the direction, the revelation comes from the acting department as almost every person in the movie has given a soulful and energetic performance, highly enjoyable and entertaining.<br/><br/>Purab Kohli as the Killer Drummer of the band comes up with a lovable and superlative act with his own unique comic touches. Luke Kenny as the keyboard player surprisingly gives a controlled &amp; subtle performance, which is really appreciable. Arjun Rampal gives the best shot of his career, as the lead guitarist and he is surely going to surprise people who called him wooden faced. Critics would find it tough to criticize him this time around.<br/><br/>And now the man who was way above the expectations, Farhan Akhtar. Before seeing the movie I was having the opinion that Farhan has just tried one movie for fun and he was only satisfying his passion for music and singing with this opportunity which came his way. But he proved me wrong. Farhan is hugely impressive and convincing in his act of the lead singer of the band. He acts easily with no hassles at all and he is exactly like he was seen in the reality shows he judged. You may feel as he is your friend next door, having mood swings like we all have and nothing filmy at all.<br/><br/>The icing on the cake is the raw voice structure he has and his singing style. It seems that he simply doesn't care about the details to be taken care of while singing. He sings brilliantly, screams at places, goes out of tune somewhere but he simply remains himself. And that's the beauty of his un-comparable and fantastic realistic approach. At times he looks arrogant but that's how his character is in the script. On the whole, with this fine attempt Farhan moves miles ahead in his career and would surely win many more fans than he had as a director.<br/><br/>Prachi Desai gives an impressive and lovable debut performance. She is sure to go places as she works harder on her looks and styling. Koel Puri in her short role is sweet. Every other supporting actor in the movie provides the required strength to the narrative and is worth praising. Director Abhishek Kapoor raises the bar of expectations and now his next venture will be highly awaited.<br/><br/>The movie is very close to being perfect with only few point of the minus side. Firstly, there is no Bass (Base) Guitarist in the band, who is considered as the backbone of a Rock Band. But that is only for the people who know the Band Requirements, otherwise this can be ignored. The only point where it lacked something is its music and lyrics. A musical movie with a rock background certainly needed more good &amp; hummable songs with some more youthful and energetic lyrics. The concert song \"Laundry Ka Bill\" is good but the \"Slow Love Song\" lacked the depth. You don't remember any particular song from this musical movie while walking out. The only thing you remember is the surprising Farhan Akhtar act and to some may be Prachi Desai.<br/><br/>In my opinion as \"Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy\" also have a good &amp; healthy relationship with \"Vishal-Shekhar\". They could have brought Vishal in, as he has the experience of being the lead singer of a rock band and has performed in the rock concerts for several years. May be he could contribute in the score and helped.<br/><br/>But keeping these thoughts aside, \"Rock On\" is a new and fresh experience for our Indian Viewers. It is a must watch for every youngster as it teaches the importance of your passions in life and the strength of a good team. It will give you power to follow your own paths and be responsible for them.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Abhishek Kapoor's 'Rock On!' is definitely an improvement when compared to his directorial debut 'Aryan' which was a 'Rocky' plus 'other boxing movies' ripoff. But, as a film itself, 'Rock On' struggles to be just strictly average. It's not a movie I would be willing to revisit. After discussing this movie with a friend, we agreed that 'Rock On' is a half-baked product. The story is too clichéd and predictable that I easily lost interest. For example, killing off the Rob character because he has no girlfriend. The rockband Magik is comprised of a typical Bollywood group of friends where Rob is the one who the audience shouldn't give much of a damn about, Joe the quiet one, KD the 'virgin' wooing the women without much luck and Aditya, the 'main one'. The characters just aren't interesting. The ending is laughably bad.<br/><br/>Moreover, there are just too many plot holes that irritated me. Since we're all supposed to believe that these guys are so passionate about music, why do they give up just after one fight? So the band dismembered but they could have pursued their own individual career. Only, Joe is seen to be struggling with his career in music but that too is apparently because 'he's no good in anything else'. Why does Aditya dump his girlfriend? If he wanted to break all ties with Magik, such that he'd dump his girlfriend through a note, why keep the photos etc?<br/><br/>On the technical side, it's not so bad. I liked the jump cuts. The background score and cinematography are alright. For a movie about rock, well, the music isn't rocking at all. I wonder what kind of the drugs the lyricist when writing those truly abysmal lyrics. The songs lack soul and energy.<br/><br/>The performances are a mixture. Shahana Goswami performs well and for a newcomer Prachi Desai is good too. Despite of having a clichéd role, Purab Kohli is perhaps the best of the male cast. Luke Kenny is adequate. Arjun Rampal is passable. Farhan Akhtar looks confused and is wooden at times.<br/><br/>Overall, 'Rock On' has nothing new to offer. It's not exactly a terrible film but I'll put it somewhere between average and below average. It's overrated. This movie just does not rock.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Abhishek Kapoor's 2008 hit 'Rock On' is easily one of the best attempts to come out in Indian Cinema. A film that vows, entertains and moves you. The story of the film is wafer-thin and also predictable, but what works for Rock On is the brilliant execution. The filmmaker deserves brownie-points for making such a true film, and ending up as a fantastic watch. Rock On is an awesome experience all the way... Two Thumbs Up!<br/><br/>Pluses of the film: Almost everything. The captain of the ship, the director is the true hero here. A fantastic script made into a a Fantastic film. Music by Shankar-Eshaan-Loy is first- rate. Performances are great: Arjun Rampal delivers a brave performance, he's natural to the core. Farhan Akhtar is strictly okay. Purab Kohli and Luke Kenny are very good. Shahana Goswami is outstanding. Parchi Desai looks cute and delivers an beautiful performance. Koel Purie is passable. <br/><br/>Minuses of the film: The film's length could've easy been trimmed.<br/><br/>All n All 'Rock On!!!' is a must see film. Strongly recommended.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Just came back from the first day, first show screening of this film! I must say that, due to all the pre-release hype and going by the excellent (and a very original) music score achieved by Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, I had very high expectations. To say that I'm a little disappointed won't be wrong but hey! Rock On!! isn't a bad movie! In fact, its far from it. Director Abhishek Kapoor (Aryan) does a fine job donning the director's cap but one can't help but see the influence that Farhan the director must've had on the movie for there are scenes which have his typical trademark style! Well, honestly when the end product is a movie like Rock On!!, I couldn't be bothered more by who's directed it and who's credited for it.<br/><br/>The story of Rock On is all about following your dreams and, as the tagline says: Living it! Now coming to the story, its about four friends: Aditya (Akhtar), Joe (Rampal), Rob (Kenny) and KD (Kohli) and their band that they choose to call \"Magick\". Their struggle to follow and accomplish their dream of making it big with \"Magick\". Cut to present day, Aditya is a businessman, Rob works under Anu Malik (yeah! watch out for the cameo by Malik lol, also look out for Javed Akhtar in the movie..... you'll be surprised to find him there, and where!! lol again!), KD does a job and Rampal runs a music shop and gives guitar lessons to kids. What caused the band to break up and will these guys get back to pursue their dreams again is what forms the rest of the story.<br/><br/>To say that Rock On!! succeeds in reminding you of Dil Chahta Hai in parts, of your schooling / college days, of the good old times that you shared with your friends, of the rare innocence you had when you started out would be nothing but describing the strong points of the film. There'd be parts where I'd feel \"ditto\" coz I've been there, done that... so have all of us at some point of time or the other.<br/><br/>Talking about the strong points of the films, well, there's more that needs to be written about! In terms of performances, this is, undoubtedly, Rampal's film. No other character has been more well defined or better performed as Rampal's Joe Mascarenhas. The scenes in which he emotes some of the feelings that his character goes through are the the high-points of the film. Oh, and btw, that's a sexed-out Santana look that Rampal carries and pulls off with panache. Watch out for him during the climax-- he steals almost every scene that he's in! Following Rampal is debutante-actor / singer, Mr. Versatile, you make Mr. Javed Akhtar proud with almost everything that you do! Farhan Akhtar gives an impressive performance and its hard to tell that this is his first (keeping in mind that The Fakir of Venice is yet to be released). Of course, the lisps and his cracked-up voice are some of the biggest flaws that Akhtar needs to work on. Surprisingly, its the same husky voice that works to his advantage as a singer. I don't know whether SEL worked on his voice in music editing softwares to get the desired results but truth be told, he sounds amazing, at least on record he does! In terms of whether Akhtar has a very bright future as an actor or not, is hard to tell just basing it on one film but if I had to go with my intution and understanding of the industry, I'd say that Akhtar the actor doesn't have a very long life span (no complaints about his performances at all! Just a word of what I feel). Prachi Desai, Purab Kohli, Bird and Luke Kenny provide apt support and all the four cast members mentioned here manage to stand their own ground, in short- impressive performances! Now coming to the music, there is nothing I could say or write that would justify the brilliance of the job done by S-E-L. Truly truly different soundtrack after such a long time. In fact, its the soundtrack which made me want to watch the film on the first place. Javed Akhtar matches the trio at every step of excellence that they tread. Its tough to point out a single favorite in an album that so many. Tum Ho To is according to me, the best-sung track by Mr. F. Akhtar in this collection of musical gems. A clever move on SEL and Akhtar's part, taking the theme music of Lakshya and making a Rock On title track out of it that truly rocks, way to go!! Zahreelay, of course, in terms of lyrics, composition, and performance is the most hatke track of the album! Listen to it carefully and you'll realise it has genius written all over it. Finally we have our first Hindi Metal number!!! Phir Dekhiye is another very, very beautiful track. Socha Hai has been my callertune for a month now--- need I say more? And of course, Pichle Saat Dino Mein: the track that soooooo defines one's life in the early years! Yeh Tumhari Meri Baatein sort of reminds me of a track that SEL had delivered in one of their earlier flicks, Yeh Kya Ho Raha Hai but then, who's complaining?? In fact, to seal it, it wouldn't be wrong to say that this is Akhtar-SEL-Akhtar's greatest album to have released since Dil Chahta Hai and that is, a very bold statement but true!</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">I went to see this film in cinema without any expectations and I really enjoyed every minute of the film. The film have a perfect narrative and the actors in it are very 'real-like' unlike the commercial Bollywood actors. The characters were well developed and my credit also goes to the cinematographer who knew his colors, angles and lights. Finally, I hope the screenplay writer gets an award, because without the perfect script a film such as Rock On!! would easily fail. The songs and music were also unique unlike commercial Bollywood love songs in the middle of a park or landscape.<br/><br/>Get your popcorn, coke, water and sit back and enjoy this film.<br/><br/>Rock On!!

      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">Starting up a rock band by the name of Magik, four friends have the dream of shooting to stardom with their rock music. When this dream never sees the light of day, the band split and has little contact with each other member. After 10 years, their lives become interwoven once more and the decision is made to attempt to reunite the bonds of the past.<br/><br/>The story is presented in an intriguing fashion jumping from the past to the present at will, but it never becomes distracting. This change goes to compliment the film in many ways. Not only does it make the viewing more interesting, but it helps to better understand the emotional and mental struggles of the main characters. The two most notable are Aditiya (Farhan Akhtar) and Joe (Arjun Rampal), with the former leading a prosperous life as a business man while the latter is barely able to make ends meet. The film is relatively easy to understand throughout but that doesn't mean it lacks the depth. There is a great sense of duality and confliction which arises as the film evolves. However the film can be seen to be a tad optimistic about certain factors of life, though it is nothing detrimental to the film as a whole, especially when the film has some melancholic moments. There is also a factor overlooked in the story: when the band attempts to reunite it appears to have no effect on the busy lives of those involved in the business world, notably Aditiya, with a similar social problem only affecting Joe.<br/><br/>There is a minor problem in regards to the English subtitling whereby spoken English is incorrectly subtitled, at one point even changing what was said entirely, though it was an unimportant scene of dialogue.<br/><br/>On the acting side, the actors perform quite well. Rock On!! marks Akhtar's acting debut after success with script writing and directing, and he adds another skill to his growing list of talents, even that of singing. He is well suited with strong presence next to Rampal who plays a more delicate role. They both play off one another extremely well and the chemistry between both shows whether in normal interaction or when the band is performing on stage. But this is not to say that both remain constant opposites of one another, for both have these subtle moments when they reverse characteristics, but it so dependent on the situation and goes to show the complex structure of the characters themselves, with character development being apparent, though perhaps not as much as one would hope. The remainder of the cast aids both main actors successfully creating a very believable context for the film.<br/><br/>The core highlight of Rock On!! is its musical score. It you enjoyed the snippet provided by the preview then you are bound to enjoy listening to an array of exhilarating track, complimented with a couple of slower pieces which allows for added variety. No matter what track is being played Rock On!! presents one of the most consistent soundtracks to grace a Bollywood film in a while. Also the production values are absolutely amazing for a Bollywood film. Rock on!! does not feel like a foreign Bollywood film at all, with the whole film feeling like a mid-to-high production Hollywood film. This is achieved with some masterful directing by Abhishek Kapoor with every scene, especially when Magick performs their music, seeming well calculated. However this does not stop Kapoor choosing some strange and rather unnecessary direction for certain scenes but this is thankfully very rare.<br/><br/>In what has been an up-and-down year for Bollywood blockbusters, Rock On!! amazingly is able to remain one string above most of the rest. There is very little to fault beyond the simple story and questionable cinematographic decisions. Rock On!! is as complete a package as you would hope for, and for a film which doesn't appear to be as widely acknowledged as other Bollywood blockbusters, Rock On!! is a true delight.</div>\n",

      "<div class=\"content\">\n",
      "<div class=\"text show-more__control\">\"Rock On!!\" is the tale of a quartet of rock musicians and their band named Magik. Aditya, the rich kid and \"creative rebel\", is the poet, lyricist, and lead vocalist of the band. Tortured soul Joe Mascarenhas is the lead guitarist. Rob is the wise and gentle keyboard player, while wacky KD (short for Killer Drummer) is the madcap drummer. They enjoy rock-star status at the college level, but dream of achieving true stardom with tours and lucrative recording contracts. However when they get their big chance of playing at a rock contest and win a coveted record contract, the dream sours and the group breaks up.<br/><br/>Ten years later, some of them have fared better than others: Adi, now a successful investment banker, has a plush office and a vast apartment that, at current Bombay real estate rates, must have cost an obscene packet. He has a pretty wife, newly pregnant, and a promotion, so one would think he is happy. But something remains amiss. Joe lives only for the music and cannot bring himself to go into the family fish business. His wife Debbie grows increasingly frustrated at his unwillingness to contribute to the family income. In the carefree days of youth, she had harbored fashion designer aspirations, but settles for handling the business end of the Mascarenhas family fish business. Rob, wise to the ways of the world, compromises by becoming a session musician, but at least he keeps on making music. Wild man KD has joined his father's jewelery business, and, predictably, derives no joy from it.<br/><br/>When circumstances bring the friends together again, Magik is re-formed, but to what end? Does each member find artistic satisfaction? Does life regain meaning and joy? It is not for me to elaborate further.<br/><br/>The story is not original. It has been done in Western cinema several times before. Rob Reiner's hilarious \"This is Spinal Tap\" mined the comedic vein, while Canadian Bruce MacDonald's \"Hard Core Logo\" took a grittier look at young rebels who never grow up. \"The Thing That You Do!\", directed by Tom Hanks, is another example that comes to mind. However, this marks the first time such a story has been filmed in an urban Indian milieu, and done extremely well, at that.<br/><br/>Abhishek Kapoor, who wrote and directed, insisted that whoever played the Adi character would have to sing his own songs, and Farhan Akhtar astonishes with both his performance and his singing. Farhan's Adi possesses credible rocker snarls and growls and, in a tender ballad, completely disarms with a sure sweet falsetto. Kapoor decreed that the other band members, too, should actually be able to play their musical instruments, and it pays off handsomely. <br/><br/>I thought the Farhan Akhtar-directed \"Dil Chahta Hai\" was a perfect film, save for one flaw: he killed off the Dimple Kapadia character. It would have been more realistic if he had the Dimple character smack Sid and say, \"Snap out of it, buddy! Go find a playmate your own age!\" And Sid could have continued on his quest for true love, sadder but so much wiser. Instead poor Dimple was made to wear horrible makeup in her hospital scene, serve as a plot point to reunite the estranged friends, and die an undignified death. She deserved a rich, sensitive, good-looking, and age-appropriate new husband or boyfriend and to live happily from then on. Otherwise, it was a splendid film, and an impressive directorial debut. It is magnificent to see Farhan Akhtar branching out as an actor and singer, but we also hope he continues to devise smart films like \"Dil Chahta Hai\". <br/><br/>Abhishek Kapoor, a one-time actor, has helmed with enormous sensitivity this story of five artistic souls (I include Joe's wife Debbie in this number), and extracted fine performances from each of his players. Arjun Rampal's Joe is a bravura piece of acting; he goes from reckless rocker to a man increasingly beaten down by life, with nothing left but his integrity. When Joe lets his long hair loose at the end and plays a stunning guitar solo, he is finally at peace, rejoicing at doing the one thing he does well. Luke Kenny as Rob and Purab Kohli as KD, are similarly first-rate. I have not seen their work before, and hope more good opportunities come their way, for they are both wonderful natural talents. The women play supporting parts with grace and dignity. I loved Shahana Goswami's Debbie, whose prickly exterior conceals her vulnerability and disappointment. She remains a fighter despite knowing failure, and is both fiercely protective of and infuriated by her impractical spouse. Prachi Desai and Koel Purie do well too, especially Prachi, as Adi's wife Sakshi, who becomes the catalyst for the band's reunion.<br/><br/>Jason West's cinematography is superb; he scores most with his footage of the rock concerts, capturing every bit of the kinetic frenzy and euphoria of such events. Shankar Ehsan Loy's aptly rambunctious music is the soul of the film, while Javed Akhtar's lyrics brim over with youthful irreverence and joie-de-vivre. The editing is just right for this sort of film, moving at a swift clip, yet holding still at emotionally important moments. But will it play in Peoria, or more relevantly, Pondicherry or Patna? Perhaps not, but I am certain it will triumph in Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, and maybe even New York, Berlin, and London, for like \"Dil Chahta Hai\", this is a film for city folknothing wrong with that.<br/><br/>To Abhishek Kapoor, I say bravo, and rock on!</div>\n",

    "For the Negative wordcloud, It is quite accurate as negative words can clearly be seen on it. However, there are few misleading words such as 'fun','best' and 'pretty' which are not exactly negative but can be seen on the wordcloud. On the otherhad, the wordcloud for positive seems to portray the positive reviews quite well with the excpetion of the word 'bad' which is seen on it and would be more suitable to the wordcloud for negative reviews."
