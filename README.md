# Movie Sentiment Analysis

### Project Overview
This project implements movie sentiment analysis by scraping reviews and ratings from the IMDB website. It utilizes the VADER sentiment analyzer to analyze the sentiment of the movie reviews and generate sentiment scores, and then it will train a decision tree classifier and SVM classifier to predict the sentiment of new movie reviews.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of reviews and ratings of seven movies collected by scraping the IMDB website. Each review is labeled with a sentiment score, indicating the overall sentiment of the review (positive, negative, or neutral).

## Prerequisites

Before running the sentiment analysis models, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python or Anaconda
- Pandas (version 1.4.2)
- NLTK (version 3.7)
- Scikit-learn (version 1.0.2)

## Model Evaluation

The performance of the sentiment analysis models can be evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
